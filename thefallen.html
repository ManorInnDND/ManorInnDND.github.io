				Moa (Carrie)
			</h3>
			<hr>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Moa was an elven druid, she carried a bow, and was fond of interacting
				with the local animals and insulting the local villans. She struggled to
				accept some of the more obscure morals of general adventuring, finding 
				fault with the seemlingly arbitrary designation of some creatures as
				"monsters", with the accompanying doctrine that "killing them is justified".
				Questioning these assumptions often led to disagreements between Moa and her allies.

			<p class="Chapter_CORE-METADATA">
				Last seen amidst the chaos of the demon attack on Sloobludop during Session 9.
