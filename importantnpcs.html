				Zoloft

			<p>
				<img src="Introduction2-web-resources/images/zoloft.png" height=150px width=150px />
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				A male dwarf ranger with a grill of semi-precious stones, Zoloft
				was hired by Noristuor to lead you to wyverns for slaying. He
				was interested in learning meditation from Galifraen but did 
				not get far. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Noristuor
			</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Introduction2-web-resources/images/noristuor.png" height=200px width=150px />
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				The resident mage of Ashabenford, Noristuor lives in a tower on
				the edge of town. Zodius approached the tower and offered his
				services. Noristuor spoke rudely and never opened his/her door
				but did offer a reward for wyvern stingers. Zoloft claims Noristuor
				also paid for his services in finding the stingers.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Torgo
			</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Introduction2-web-resources/images/torgo.png" height=150px width=150px />
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Torgo, a middle aged male human, is a low-ranking member of the Red Listen cult,
				he is awkward and avoids eye-contact - and seems oblivious to social
				cues. He provided you with information about his fellow cultists during
				your time in the  mansion. You left him at the White Hart Inn after leaving
				the mansion.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Donamoth
			</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Introduction2-web-resources/images/donamoth.png" height=130 width=200px />
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				A demon who claimed that many of you had wronged him in a past life.
				He trapped you in the mansion of a famed, and murdered explorer named
				Quincy, and attempted to kill you. You slew his partially-manifested 
				form in the basement of the mansion. Hopefully you've heard the last
				of him, at least in this lifetime.
