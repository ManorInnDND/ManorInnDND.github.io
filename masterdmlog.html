<h2>OOTA SESSIONS 1 & 1.5 </h2>
<p>The kobold explorer Yzak, the deep gnome bounty hunter Zap Rowsdower, the Maztican tabaxi martial artist Wandering Shade, the drow psionicist Zimmerl Oblodra, and the half-orc shaman Jagh Gnowske all awake in the slave pen of Velkynvelve, a drow Underdark outpost sworn to the city of Menzoberranzan where they have all been brough within the last tenday. Its commander, the Lolth priestess Ilvara Mizzrym, has let her prisoners know that if they accept their fates and learn to obey, they may survive.

    The first day after the heroes begin to work together to find freedom is eventful. Zap and his fellow deep gnome Turvy, assigned to wash dishes, tries to get by with minimal effort but his slacking is noticed by a quaggoth guard, who smashes a plate over Zap's head. 
    Jagh spools rope with the full orc bully Ront, who first tries to denigrate him for his mixed heritage, but after Jagh punches one of his tusks off admits that he is hiding his insecurities, namely that he is ashamed at his capture and believes that Gruumsh is punishing him for his cowardice. Zimmerl and the dwarf Eldeth are assigned to empty chamber pots in the pool beneath the outpost. Zimmerl notices a gray ooze lurking in the waters below, and attempts to force Eldeth closer to the water to clean herself by throwing drow poop on her. She clobbers him with a chamber pot in reply, and the drow guards break up their fight. The others are assigned to perform menial, often meaningless tasks simply for the amusement of the drow, such as cleaning already-immaculate barracks. Yzak is assigned to work the winch-powered lift with Derendil, a quaggoth who claims to be a cursed elf prince. Derendil offers Yzak rich lands and a keep in his kingdom once they return to the surface world.
    
    Back in the cell at mealtime, Ront bullies the pacifist kuo-toa Shuushar the Awakened, but the dwarf Eldeth stands up to him, with the svirfneblin Jimjar betting on the outcome. Derendil approaches Zimmerl, informing the drow that the dark elves will be defeated. The svirfneblin twins Topsy and Tuvy mutter darkly to one another in a corner. After falling asleep, Zimmerl has a disturbing dream of oily tentacles sliding to brush up against him while a great buzzing and howling rises in the distance. He awakes in a cold sweat, feeling as though something is out there in the dark depths – something far worse than the drow.
    
    DAY TWO 
    In the second day, Zimmerl, Yzak, and Sarith are assigned to prepare and serve a delicious meal of toadstool steak, a task at which Zimmerl excels. Yzak manages to steal a rolling pin and a pair of knives from the kitchen and smuggle them back into the cell. Jagh and a genial derro named Buppido are assigned to stack rocks, which the drow knock over and force them to arrange again. This day Zap and the myconid sprout Stool are put on chamber pot duty, attempting to follow up on Zimmerl's intelligence that a gray ooze exists there, but is unable to trick any drow into its clutches.
    
    Before bedtime, the drow Sarith (a former guard accused of murder) bullies Sprout into giving up its "prime sleeping spot", but Zimmerl offers to share his spot, earning the myconid's thanks. This night Zimmerl and Jagh have a nightmare, this time of dark shadows moving and reaching out towards him as he wanders lost through endless mazes of tunnels.
    
    In which the heroes find themselves prisoners of the drow, and launch an imperfect dash for freedom that comes with a cost.
    
    CHAPTER ONE – PRISONERS OF THE DROW
    DAY ONE
    
    DAY THREE 
    On the third day, Yzak distributes weaponry in the hopes of a slave rebellion, arming Zap as well as Sarith and Eldeth. With Yzak, Zimmerl, and the derro Buppido assigned to arrange rocks on the cavern floor, the party is split from the onset. Zap and Shuushar are on kitchen duty in the outpost proper, with Shade and Topsy filling and hauling water barrels. Waiting for his overseer to go get him some knives (the others being missing), Zap takes the opportunity to escape, though he fails to convince the pacifist Shuushar to follow. Zap and Shade sneak around the outpost and attack the drow, though the elite warriors prove tough to defeat. Meanwhile down below, Zimmerl uses his mental powers to trick a quaggoth into protecting them as they kill the drow overseer. Taking the lift back up, they, Buppido, and their charmed quaggoth join Zap, Shade, and Turvy in fighting. The elite guards and enemy quaggoths prove too much, however, and Shade and Buppido are knocked unconscious as their charmed quaggoth is slain. Zap, hiding underfoot, tries to help evacuate his allies by tossing them off the landing onto the thick webs below before making good their escape. Zimmerl is able to lower his silk rope, via which he and Yzak shimmy down to the cavern floor below. Before the others are able to follow, they are attacked by giant spiders in the webs as drow guards rain poisoned crossbow bolts from above.
    
    Meanwhile, Jagh has used a pet tarantula – secreted away in the slave pen and befriended – to distract their overseeing guard so his work partner Jimjar can steal a sword. Jimjar, a master of deception and stealth, is able to use Jagh as a distraction, running off and sneaking back around invisibly to slash their guard's throat and throw the body off the ledge. Stashing a sword in the slave pen, Jimjar sneaks off to the cavern floor below in the confusion of the uprising to join Yzak and Zimmerl in hiding.
    
    With the other prisoners back in their cell, Mistress Ilvara commands her minions to teach the slaves a lesson against the price of disobedience: though she was not one of the rebels, the dwarf Eldeth Feldrun is dragged from the cell by quaggoths and thrown down to the webs below, where she is devoured alive by giant spiders as a sacrifice to Lolth. As she is pulled away to her fate, Eldeth screams for the heroes to bring her shield and warhammer back to her kin of Clan Feldrun back in Gauntlgrym.</p>
    <h2>Session 2</h2>
    <p>
        In which the heroes escape from bondage into the strange and maddening caverns of the Underdark.

DAY THREE (cont.) 
With the slaves back in their pen after their failed escape, the outpost commander Ilvara Mizzrym begins a speech, starting her speech with a rumble like an earthquake that continues for the next minute. Her eyes change to become like those of a spider. She informs them that the dwarf Eldeth Feldrun was executed not because she was part of the revolt – which she was not – but because they are not worthy of names, nor of telling them apart. Ront the orc laughs, saying the dwarf had it coming anyway. The rest of the slaves are punished with withholding the day's ration of fungus soup, with the ones who did revolt (Zap, Shade, Buppido, and Topsy) personally blasted by her with Rays of Sickness.

Noting the absence of one of the deep gnomes (Jimjar), the scarred former lieutenant of the outpost Jorlan recalls that his work partner for the day was the orc Jagh. Ilvara has the quaggoths drag Jagh out of the cell and bring him to the shrine of Lolth, where she slides the arms of her Tentacle Rod around his throat and wrists, demanding to know Jimjar's location and intentions. When a useless answer gets him savagely scourged, Jagh throws off his questioner by saying he doesn't know.

Meanwhile in the cavern below, Yzak and Zimmerl have found a small cave to hide in. While out gathering food for the night, Yzak is surprised by Jimjar, who finds them a better hiding spot, in which they hide as Shoor and his patrol come chasing after them. Jimjar and Zimmerl disguise themselves as drow guards with Yzak as their prisoner, and decide to break back into the outpost to free their cellmates and retrieve Yzak's lost family map.

Back in the cell, the slaves are surprised when Jorlan comes to the bars and sends the guards out of earshot. They are even more surprised when the scarred drow asks "If I offered you a chance to escape, would you take it?" Jagh demands the drow's intentions. Though Jorlan makes it clear he doesn't care if the party lives or dies, he wants an escape attempt so as to embarrass Ilvara since she cast him aside as her lover and lieutenant after he was scarred. When prodded, he tells the party about an armory in the guard post nearest them, but insists he can do no more.

Hours later, during the midnight guard shift, Jorlans' gambit begins as he leaves the slave pen unlocked and the heroes sneak out. Meanwhile, the other half of the party plus Jimjar arrive in the outpost, their disguise getting them past the quaggoths working the lift. After Zap and Shade sneak into the guard post and sneak attack the drow inside, the two halves of the party unite and plunder the armory. Though some want to flee Velkynvelve immediately, it is decided to scour the outpost for their personal belongings first. The shrine of Lolth is robbed first, with Zap prying off several black gemstones from a spider-shaped idol. In Mistress Ilvara's private chambers, Zap unlocks a chest and resists its poisoned needle trap, finding their gear stashed within, as well as the late Eldeth Feldrun's shield and warhammer. Finally, he finds a small jar containing an illithid tadpole, which he smashes before Zimmerl can grab it from him.

After looting Lieutenant Shoor's chambers, the group hears an unholy buzzing and screeching. Flying through the cavern outside, the party can see out the stalactite's windows to see chasme and vrock demons battling one another in a flying chase. The drow call themselves to arms, taking up the defense of their outpost as the demons bring their skirmish closer. Taking advantage of the guards' distraction, the party runs onto the rope bridge outside and jumps into the webbing below, cutting themselves free just fast enough to avoid being eaten by giant spiders. Landing in the pool at the base of the waterfall, the party is attacked by a gray ooze, which unexpectedly speaks into their minds, hissing "Flesh for the Faceless Lord!" as its slimy pseudopods try to corrode the heroes' flesh – apparently the ooze is a follower of Juiblex, the demon prince of slime.



After killing the ooze, the party is about to flee from Velkynvelve through the western passage when one of the vrocks crash-lands in front of them, badly wounded. The vulture-like demon screeches at them, but the party is able to punch through its resistances and kill it before it can rend any of them limb from limb. Slaying the demon, the heroes and their erstwhile comrades flee into the darkness that awaits.

CHAPTER TWO – INTO DARKNESS

DAY THREE (cont.) 
With Yzak scouting ahead and Sarith and Derrendil manning the front line, the party tears through the Underdark at a fast clip. Sarith establishes himself as a knowledgeable Underdark expert, saying they need to travel quickly since Shoor and Jorlan will compete to see who can bring them in faster. They need to stay on the move, and not draw attention to themselves in settlements, lest any spies of Menzoberranzan send word to their pursuers. With Yzak's ranging abilities and Jagh creating Goodberries, even their large party is properly fed, and they are able to travel without light since everyone has darkvision. Sarith, the former soldier of Menzoberranzan, advocates killing the myconid Stool since the little sprout cannot travel quickly. Ront agrees. Derendil picks up the myconid and carries him, citing his "royal duty" to aid his lessers.

Stool, suspended on Derrendil's back, asks all sorts of questions of Zimmerl, whom he has adopted as a sort of older brother after the drow defended him from Sarith in the slave pen. Jimjar brings up the demon attack on Velkynvelve, saying it was odd even for the Underdark. And didn't the gray ooze mention a "Faceless Lord"? Zimmerl knows that this is one of the titles of Juiblex, the demon prince of slime, also known as the Oozing Hunger. He is a noxious creature that exists only to consume. Combined with all the strange nightmares they've been having of late, the group thinks that somehow the demon princes have come to have influence over the Underdark.

Toward the end of the day, the group runs into a stalagmite in a large cavern with a sigil carved into it. Zimmerl and Sarith recognize this as a drow warning sign proclaiming demons ahead. Though nothing molests them in the night, the entire group has unsettling dreams of festering wounds that burst open with swarms of insects and maggots.

DAY FOUR 
After a few hours' march, the caverns the party passes through become quite narrow, eventually no more than a tunnel. Moreover, the tunnel is overrun with thick spiderwebs, which eventually become impassable. Zap lights a torch and melts the webs away, keeping a good distance from the giant spiders above. The sight of his flame, however, inspires three shrieker fungi to earn their name. The loud shrieking echoing through the caverns points the pursuing drow in their direction, and the party barrels through the tunnel.

While foraging for the day in the larger cavern they find themselves in, Jimjar bets Jagh that he can forage more food that day – a wager which the druid loses. That evening, after setting up camp, the group is surprised when a steam vent below them erupts. While they are able to get to safe ground by sensing the stone heat up before the eruption, the noise draws a carrion crawler hoping to find a body. They slay the beast.

DAY FIVE
The next day, the party is attacked by a large mob of dretches, pathetic, wretched demons that hate themselves as much as they hate mortals. The heroes easily kill their opponenents as Prince Derendil lays waste to his own, tearing his foemen limb from limb and savagely biting them, afterward apologizing for the savagery he is losing himself to in this quaggoth form.

Yzak takes some of the meat harvested from the carrion crawler and makes it an offering to nature. For this he is awarded with the loyalty of a giant wolf spider. Returning to camp, the beastmaster is dismayed when his new partner hisses at Zap – and only Zap. Asking his new friend (Araigne) what the matter is, Yzak is told that Zap bears "the mark of Lolth." The group discerns that the black gems that Zap robbed from the shrine at Velkynvelve must bring a curse on the bearer of the hatred of spider-kin.

The tunnels become so thin that the group must travel single file. The walls are lined with Ormu, a bioluminescent fungus that Jagh harvests some of. Eventually Ront the orc begins berating Sarith, the "group leader" (since he walks in front) for bringing them this way. Jagh is able to conciliate before the orc causes any violence. 
The group makes camp in the tunnel itself, too tired to continue on.

DAY SIX 
Finally leaving the cramped tunnel, the party emerges into a large cavern full of fungi. As Shuushar rambles about pacifism, enlightenment, Sloobludop, and someone there named Plooploopleen, they run across another warning sign proclaiming demons ahead. They also spy a band of orcs led by an Eye of Gruumsh wandering through the cavern, perhaps lost in the Underdark. Hiding, they quickly devise a plan to have Ront approach them – though they are Many-Arrows orcs and he is of the Iceshield tribe – and bargain for their passage. As the group looks on – with only Jagh understanding the Orcish tongue – Ront instead decides to join his fellow orcs. The heroes are not sad to see him go, given his disruptive outbursts and the fact that Ront didn't point the orcs in their direction. 

Moving on, they encounter a group of steeder-mounted duergar traders who are packing up camp. Before the gray dwarves leave, the party peruses their wares and presses them for information concerning Sloobludop, confirming rumors that the village is split between two religious factions. For payment, Zap makes sure to use one of the Lolth-cursed gems, envisioning the steeders turning on their masters. Zimmerl psionically focuses on the gem, ensuring that he can sense from its location for the next day. As the duergar leave, the party takes their campsite for their own, within three miles of Sloobludop. Jimjar reveals that he stole a bag of ball bearings from them, tossing it to Zap.

DAY SEVEN 
Almost immediately after they set off toward the kuo-toa village, there is a tremor that cuts off the passage the heroes are in, cutting them off from their companions and knocking out Yzak. The rest of the group finds that the quake also opened up another passage, which soon leads to a carved stone complex. Waiting inside on a ceiling is a gray ooze, which the party sneaks past. Just beyond it, they find a gelatinous cube with the skeletal remains of a drow and his still-intact mace inside. Before they draw weapons, the cube reaches out to their minds and greets them. After a confused palaver, the ooze proclaims its name is Glabagool, that it is intrigued by them, and wishes to accompany them on their travels. As a show of good faith, it grants them the mace within itself. Intrigued themselves by an intelligent, telepathic ooze, the party agrees.

After battling a gray ooze in another room, the heroes note they are more tired than usual – the air in here is perceptibly stale and thin. With the tremor cutting off the tunnel, they are running out of air. Jagh decides to go back alone to the Oozing Temple's entry to drag Yzak ahead. Before getting to his kobold ally, he is ambushed by the gray ooze they had initially sneaked past, which the other heroes are able to help him slay.

Moving deeper into the Temple, the group is dismayed to find that not only are they running out of air, they are gaining water. The tremor broke the ceiling in one eastern chamber, diverting an underground river that is now slowly flooding the Temple. Though Jagh has an idea of how to escape after Glabagool oozes through ceiling cracks and swims up the river to find a large open cavern, the heroes decide to quickly loot the Temple even as they run out of air.

Glabagool tells the party that the four western corridors are each guarded by a black pudding, which he says are in hiding. He crawls along one hall and quivers to show the pudding's location. Shade scouts down the hall, and at the noted location, the flagstone beneath him cracks open, and he falls into a pit with a waiting black pudding. Thus begins a desperate and bloody battle, with Shade very nearly dying multiple times, on the opposite side of the pit from the druid to exhausted to reach and heal him. Hero after hero flees the pudding until only Zap remains, picking away with his hand crossbows. He jumps over the pit, finally clearing the way for Glabagool to inch down the hallway, engulfing his fellow ooze in defense of his new friends.

The battered party arrives in a room with a fountain full of dark water, under which are submerged various treasures that are retrieved one by one via Zap's arcane Mage Hand. Before leaving the fountain room, Zimmerl examines one of several formless statues, only to find they are gray oozes that attack. These attack the battered heroes and Glabagool, putting them at the limit of exhaustion in the ensuing fracas.

Limping away from the battle and wading through the deepening water, Jagh casts Thunderwave on the ceiling, breaking apart the stone ceiling with the blast and quickening the torrent of water. As the temple is quickly flooded, the party swims upward through the subterranean river and into the open cavern discovered by Glabagool. Finding their motley band of companions sneaking up on Glab to kill it, the party quickly explains that the ooze has joined the party. Buppido grudgingly hands Jimjar a gold piece, having lost a bet that the party would not emerge from the cave-in.

<h2>Session 4</h2>
<p>
    

In which the heroes recuperate from their dungeon delve, and after much combat reach the kuo-toa village of Sloobludop.

Day Eight 
Recuperating from their near-death exhaustion from the Oozing Temple, the heroes' second watch (Zimmerl, the derro Buppido, and their new ooze friend Glabagool) is surprised by wet, flopping sounds emanating from their camp. They find that their pacifist kuo-toa companion Shuushar the Awakened has awakened – except not really. It turns out that kuo-toa often sleepwalk, and with their lidless eyes it is difficult to tell when. While patrolling the perimeter, Zimmerl comes across some fungal "memory orbs," taking in the spores, and the last memories of a beholder spying on a slinking drow ranger with twin scimitars and his powerful panther companion.

Day Nine
While marching away from their campsite, the party spies a band of goblins from the surface world traveling through the same cavern. Setting up an ambush, the party hastily kills the goblin boss, and cuts down the common goblins with ease. The last two flee, but one runs straight into the transparent Glabagool and is immediately dissolved, with the other catching a crossbow bolt in the back.

Getting near the Darklake, Yzak spies a small guard unit of kuo-toa led by a whip (one of the many priests of the strange race of deity-inventors). Shuushar says that, according to the rumors they've heard of humanoids being caught for sacrifice by the cult of the Deep Father, this is likely the mission of this group. Shuushar is sent by the heroes to give diplomacy a chance – and is promptly captured by the whip with his pincer staff. The party attacks as the kuo-toa lead Shuushar away, killing all the Deep Father worshipers. Another group of the fish-men approach immediately thereafter, but they are led by Plooploopleen, the archpriest of the Sea Mother. Ploop recognizes Jagh from the time he helped the half-orc escape the Underdark, and begins leading the heroes toward Sloobludop, speaking of their common foe in the Deep Father cult.

Plooploopleen, although an ally, is still an evil and insane fish-person. Though Jagh urgently tells him about the drow party chasing them through the Underdark, Ploop dismisses this threat, saying the drow will not risk threatening the kuo-toa, and that now they must deal with the dangers in the village rather than without. He wants the party to help him against his daughter Bloppblippodd by allowing him to turn them over to her as potential sacrifices. Blopp, in her zeal, will not believe the party to be threats and will not bind or disarm them. Then, during the ceremony, Ploop and the party will strike and disrupt the ritual. Asking what would happen if they refuse, Ploop shrugs and says that he will simply hand them over anyway, but will not be able to count on their support. Agreeing that armed captivity is not so bad, the party decides to go along with Ploop's plan as they reach the fishing-net walls of Sloobludop.

    OOTA SESSION 5
</h2>
<p>
    In which the heroes enter the kuo-toan village, turned on itself as the two feuding heads of Demogorgon, only to witness its devastation as the Prince of Demons rises from the Darklake.

CHAPTER THREE – THE DARKLAKE 
Day Nine (cont.) 
Plooploopleen, archpriest of Blibdoolpoolp in Sloobludop and Jagh's onetime savior, leads the party into the village, which looks like a tangle of reeds stretching up into the darkness, lit by glowing spots of phosphorescence. These "reeds" are in fact a series of rickety towers, lashed together by rope and plank bridges in haphazard fashion. Standing protectively before this is a wall of heavy nets woven throughout with heavy bone hooks. Ploop leads the party through the gate and past a teleportation circle, toward the Shrine of the Sea Mother. 



The Shrine consists of a wooden statue of Blibdoolpoolp (a nude female humanoid with the head and claws of giant albino crayfish crudely lashed to it with gut) adorned with shells, mushrooms, and rotting fish. It is guarded by several watchful monitors, who allow worshipful kuo-toa to approach for such supplications as vomiting at the Sea Mother's feet – Ploop explains that as a scavenger deity, such offerings are accepted as a sincere show of faith. Zap spits on the statue to make a token offering, and Ploop nods approvingly.

Plooploopleen takes them to his adjacent hovel, where his son and whip Glooglugogg loudly objects to involving outsiders in sacred matters – but Ploop tells him to to go with the flow of life. Ploop wants to give the party an hour to rest and recuperate at his adjacent hovel before baiting the hook and "offering" them as sacrifices to his daughter. The party demands the entire night instead, and eventually Ploop relents, saying they will go first thing in the morning. 



Ploop warns the heroes to give the Deep Father altar a wide berth. Zimmerl and Shuushar go to the docks to procure boats to make a speedy getaway after they disrupt the ceremony, arranging for a keelboat and three rowboats to be brought to the area near the altar first thing in the morning. Shade meanwhile visits a weaponsmith, and is cheated when the merchant accepts his shortsword in trade for a common spear. Zimmerl also focuses his psionic investigation on a crossbow bolt and shoots it into the lake so he can see what is below the depths, but he finds only ixitxachitl.

Yzak sneaks the fifty feet across town from the Sea Mother shrine to the Deep Father altar, keeping watch on the area. The altar itself is topped with two dead octopi tied together atop a dead manta ray. He sees a bruised, bound, and bedraggled duergar dragged into a nearby hovel, but makes no moves toward rescue. Seeing no sign of the archpriestess Blopplipodd or other developments, he returns to Ploop's hut with the others. The party keeps watch all night, sleeping in shifts, as they do not trust the kuo-toan attendants sharing the room with them. Zimmerl, however, is the one who breaks trust by sneaking over to Ploop's closet and stealing a cache of potions, pearls, and scrolls.



Day Ten
At the break of dawn – if the Underdark had a dawn – Plooploopleen awakens the party for their mission. The party, 12 kuo-toa, a monitor, Ploop, and Gloog progress to the altar. Wanting to make sure they are on the same page, the party clarifies by asking if he will be angered should they slay his daughter – Ploop simply replies that there will be one fewer worshiper of the Deep Father if that occurs.

The delegation, led by Plooploopleen, arrives at the Deep Father altar, where they are received by Blopplippodd. Ploop says that her power is evident, and that he acknowledges her divine vision with the offering of these humanoids. The Deep Father cultists prod the heroes toward the altar, where the whip Klibdoloogut waits to sacrifice them one by one. True to Ploop's prediction, Blopp does not bind or disarm them, believing in her divine destiny. No one seems to notice when Zap uses Mage Hand to steal Blopp's sacrificial dagger.



Kuo-toa do not stand still for long, and the two factions are quickly mixed together beyond distinction. Meanwhile, several zealous followers throw themselves in a heap on the ground for Blopp to stand upon so she can be physically higher than her school of followers. As the chanting grows louder and the ritual is about to begin, Ploop strikes his daughter with his scepter, and bloodshed begins. The heroes kill their jailers without much trouble, though the whip Klib presents more of a challenge. As they strike him down, the flow of battle brings them face to face with Blopplippodd and one of her monitor minions. The archpriestess, caught off guard by the surprise attack and willing to use extreme countermeasures, casts Control Water, raising the Darklake and flooding the northern half of Sloobludop. Zimmerl and Jagh are swept away, having to rush back toward combat via the rickety bridges hanging between hovels.

As the Deep Father archpriestess is finally slain, she cries out "Leemoogoogoon!", calling for her deity. The dark surface of the lake bubbles and foams as a thick, oily tentacle bursts forth, followed by another, and then by two monstrous heads resembling hideous, angry baboons with wickedly curved tusks. Both heads are attached to the same torso, and this beast must stand thirty feet tall at least, with water cascading down its back and shoulders.



Demogorgon wades toward Sloobludop, heads roaring and gibbering as his tentacles flail and smash against the water. Zap goes mad for a moment at the sight of the Prince of Demons, but regains his senses enough to cast an illusion of his patron deity, Baravar Cloakshadow, standing in the air with arms crossed. Unfortunately, Demogorgon is not cowed by the "avatar" of this gnome god, although Jimjar approves of Zap's illusory craftmanship. Meanwhile the party sees that kuo-toa of both cults standing in the shallow shore waters are being dragged under by something, and are stabbing at unseen foes beneath the red-foamed waves. The party hastily bails into the boats arranged by Zimmerl and begins rowing furiously out into the Darklake. One of Demogorgon's thrashing tentacles strikes near the party's makeshift flotilla, and Shade is thrown overboard only to be attacked by a vampiric ixitxachitl. Although Shade is a tabaxi and can easily climb back aboard, Yzak jumps overboard to kill the demon ray. After a feverish fight on the water's surface, the ranger hauls the dead aberration out of the water and lashes it to his rowboat's prow. With Demogorgon rampaging through the village, demolishing docks and buildings with single swings of his tentacles, the party furiously rows into the Darklake toward what they hope is safety.

<p>In which the heroes enter the Darklake, finding it no safer than the dry portions of the Underdark, and hold long palaver regarding their next move.</p>
<p>Day Ten (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
The party's stolen flotilla (a keelboat and three rowboats) makes it into a tunnel leaving the main cavern of Sloobludop as "Leemoogoogoon" wrecks the village. Hemeth, duergar captive of the Leemoogoogoon cult, thanks the party for the rescue, explaining he is an arms smuggler in employ of Clan Ironhead, a weaponsmithing clan who are business rivals of the deepking's Clan Steelshadow. He was leading the duergar merchants the party met just before entering Sloobludop, but says they mutinied and sold him to the kuo-toa. He says he will stay with the party until they visit Gracklstugh, not only for a safe return home but also so he can repay the life debt he owes them via a favor. He arms himself with the fallen Eldeth Feldrun's shield and warhammer, disappointed he must resort to non-duergar craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the boats are attacked from below by merrow, hulking merfolk twisted into service to Demogorgon. One, not bothering trying to hit a dexterous tabaxi monk, instead attacks Shade's boat hull, trying to sink him, but the shadowdancer is able to cling to the side of his boat and counterattack with spear thrusts. Another wildly attacks the crew of other boats, and a low ceiling nearly knocks everyone overboard as the boats go down the dark tunnel. Though they are powerful fighters, the merrow are slain and their heads mounted on the prow of Zap's boat.<br>
<br>

<p>Finding a narrow, rocky shore, the party beaches their boats to make hasty repairs to Shade's rowboat while Yzak looks for the day's food. Meanwhile, there is a zurkhwood mushroom whose cap is suitable to fashion into a makeshift raft, so the whole motley crew lends a hand and puts the spare raft onto the keelboat.</p>
<p>As the others work, Zimmerl focuses his mental senses on a piece of driftwood, and sends it down a current identified by Yzak as going back to Sloobludop. He mystically reaches out to it, seeing the devastation of the village, as well as the drow pursuit party.</p>
<p>Seeing that nothing is directly pursuing them, the party decides to set up camp. After a short while, a keelboat packed full of kuo-toa refugees comes up the river. There is some talk of killing the fishfolk and taking their boat, but the heroes decide against subterranean river piracy…for now. The kuo-toa sail past the camp without incident.</p>
<p>Day Eleven&nbsp;<br>
Before setting off, the camp is attacked by a water elemental that arises from the river – it is acting oddly malicious for an elemental. Zimmerl is able to trick it into thinking that Shade is a fire elemental, earning both its ire and its fear.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882023/water_weird.PNG?1532144496"></p>
<p>With this water weird&nbsp;destroyed, the party has a long debate over their next destination. Before Demogorgon's rising this had been decided as Neverlight Grove, which Stool, Sarith, Derendil, and Jimjar still support. Buppido proposes Gracklstugh. Yzak throws out the wildcard suggestion of returning to Sloobludop to quietly loot the ruins, hoping that Blopplipodd had as much treasure as her father did. One by one the kobold is able to convince Jagh, Shade, and Zap to go on his stealth mission, and even Jimjar agrees to go as part of a wager with Zap. Of the main heroes, only Zimmerl refuses to go, staying with their cohorts at the camp as the others travel on foot back to Sloobludop.</p>
<p>Less than a minute after setting off, while in the side cavern where Yzak foraged for food, the party finds a coffin lying in a shallow pool. Overcome with curiosity, they convince Zap to open it, which he does with maximum caution (hiding behind an illusory wall 30 ft away, using his Mage Hand to manipulate his thieves' tools from afar). Of course, a mummy emerges from the coffin and nearly succeeds in spreading its horrible rotting curse to the party before Araigne tangles it in webs and Jagh crushes its desiccated skull with his flaming drow mace. Carefully searching the coffin, wary of traps, Zap finds a small idol to a forgotten god (and leaves it, figuring it is cursed), as well as a golden fishtank in a hidden compartment at the mummy's feet, complete with dead fish inside.<br>

<span class="caps">SCOUTING</span> <span class="caps">SLOOBLUDOP</span>&nbsp;<br>
Day Eleven (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
Having destroyed the mummy near their dangerous campsite and looted its sarcophagus, the party is approached by Buppido, who pats Yzak on the back with well-wishes – the kobold feels a sense of a guiding hand, as though his stealth efforts have been somehow blessed. Shade channels his qi to cloak the stealth team in shadows, and Zap, Yzak, Shade, and Jimjar sneak the mile or so toward Sloobludop as Zimmerl and the others stay with the boats. They arrive at the same gate they had originally arrived at two days previous, but this time they scale the wall of netting rather than walk through the gate, and Zap takes a nasty gash from a heavy bone hook woven into the wall. From atop the wall they survey the town, and Zap wins a wager with Jimjar that he could bypass the walls without being seen by mounting Yzak's spider Araigne and scouting the village from the cavern ceiling 100 ft above. He sees smashed docks, buildings, and kuo-toa bodies in the wake of Demogorgon's rampage. The demon lord is nowhere to be seen, but merrow and a scrag (aquatic troll) wander the shore, and bands of kuo-toa dart across darkened streets and huddle in their hovels, many of them driven quite mad. Yzak, the mission commander, decides that whatever treasure Blopplipodd may have had is not worth the risk, and orders a retreat. As the party withdraws from the walls, a swarm of chasme demons flies into the cavern, filling it with a horrible buzzing drone and signaling the wisdom of their leaving. Zap wins 20 GP from Jimjar, but loses a shiny electrum since Jimjar successfully held the Lolth-cursed gem while Zap was spiderborne.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at camp, Zimmerl is explaining to Stool and Glabagool why the kuo-toa were trying to kill them when a patch of darkness blacker than black approaches the camp. Recognizing this as magical, Zimmerl, Derendil, Sarith, and Buppido dash to the boats, intent on shoving off and abandoning the stealth team. Before they can set sail, the darkness falls upon Zimmerl and Derendil, and horrible octopus-like creatures – darkmantles – try to suffocate them. Zimmerl is unable to use his psionics since he is blinded, and the combatants are just able to kill the darkmantles before either victim falls.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882026/Darkmantle.PNG?1532146310"></p>
<p>As the group recovers, Buppido runs off to see if the stealth team has returned. When the others do approach the river cavern, as they are passing the sarcophagus they find a macabre scene: freshly butchered kuo-toa limbs and organs, arrayed in a spiral. Sarith suggests the degenerate kuo-toa have a new cult that is responsible for this – they invent their own gods; what kind of<br>
insanity is that? But Zap is reminded of the holy symbol of the rarely-worshiped derro demigod Diinkarazan, a deity of vengeance who was betrayed by his brother Diirinka to remain in the captivity of the illithid god Ilsensine when the two were thieving the secrets of magic from him. Zap finds Buppido's denial that he worships Diinkarazan unconvincing, so he steals the derro's dagger and asks Zimmerl to psionically investigate the weapon. Zimmerl finds that, while standing watch in the side cavern, Buppido chanced to spot a kuo-toa fleeing Sloobludop and gleefully chased down the fish-man, spearing him through the back. Drawing his dagger, Buppido gutted the kuo-toa with surgical precision, and efficiently arrayed the body parts in Diinkarazan's spiral as he muttered that he was himself the manifestation of the god, who sends an avatar of vengeance to the Material Plane every 50 years to go on a killing spree, considering every victim who falls in his path to be part of his divine plan. Zap puts the dagger back in Buppido's belt unnoticed, and after quiet discussion the party decides to keep him for now, as a guaranteed entry to Gracklstugh.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882029/Buppido.PNG?1532147702"></p>
<p>As the party boards their boats, Derendil, clearly distraught, apologizes for his lack of leadership, saying that he should never have let the heroes bicker for so long about their next destination. He goes on to form their grand strategy, declaring their chief goal should be to bring Eldeth Feldrun's warhammer and shield to Gauntlgrym and present them to her kin, so that Prince Derendil might attend the court of King Bruenor Battlehammer and form a royal alliance. In the meantime, he must protect his lessers, so he proposes bringing the other Underdark dwellers each back to their home cities before going on the long journey to Gauntlgrym. Topsy laughs, musing (in Gnomish) that she sometimes forgets other races allow males positions of leadership.</p>
<p>After a few hours' rowing, Yzak (in the lead boat) hears what sounds like livestock mooing – perhaps a herd of deep rothé. Beaching their boats, the party heads down a side passage, leaving their followers behind. After about 100 yards, they come into a larger passage, finding the rothé are tended by a matronly shield dwarf named Maven Delve, who seems blissfully unaware of the madness of the Underdark, inviting the party to sit and drink her milk and to stay the night in her cavern if they like. She seems delighted by Zap's use of Mage Hand to drink his milk – an appreciation for the arcane that the gnome notices as out of character for a dwarf.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882031/Deep_Rothe.JPG?1532148168"><br>
<br>
When they start asking too many questions, Delve cries out and points at a drow scout on a nearby ridge. Though Yzak sends Araigne to outflank the drow, Maven Delve seems impatient that the party is not going after him wholesale, and the drow does not move despite the heroes pointing and looking at him. Yzak, sensing something is wrong, attacks Delve, who in turn tries to curse the ranger, who resists her attempt to rob his sense of direction. When the monk Shade hits her as well, he feels that her flesh is rough and warty, rather than the smooth dwarf flesh she presents. Maven Delve, sensing the jig is up, reveals her true nature as a green hag before turning invisible and attempting to flee for her life. The party, however, brings the full brunt of their assault to bear on her, and with a lucky strike Yzak is able to strike down the wicked fey. As she dies, Delve wails that her sisters will avenge her. Having earned the ire of a witch coven, the party resolves to hunt down the hags before they can work their evil magic.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882030/Green_Hag.PNG?1532148055"></p>
<p>The deep rothé herd vanished when Delve's false nature was revealed, but a large box – three feet by three feet – still sits on the cavern floor. Zap opens it in his usual cautious way, with Mage Hand from 30 ft away from behind an illusory rock. Looking inside, he finds there are three small, articulated dolls resembling himself, Yzak, and Araigne. Unbidden, the three figurines clamber out of the box and re-enact the stealth return to Sloobludop, bewildering the heroes. How did Maven Delve have such things? If she used divination, how did she pierce Zap's continual Nondetection? Shutting and re-opening the box several times by various party members had the figures re-appear as different party members, or even as Demogorgon and the kuo-toa archpriests, re-enacting their recent deeds. Zimmerl investigates the box psionically, finding that Delve traveled to this cavern not on foot, but on the back of a 12-ft walking clay statue that has merged with the ground they are standing on. Knowing the way back to the covens' lair, the party resolves to end this threat at the dark heart of the Darklake.</p>

<p>In which the heroes embark on a witch hunt, facing the murderous minions of the Darklake hag coven.</p>
<p>Day Eleven (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">PLOTTING</span> A <span class="caps">COURSE</span><br>
With Zimmerl having mystically perceived the way back to the hag coven's island lair, Yzak plots a waterborne course toward it that will take 24 hours of straight sailing. Returning to the boats, the heroes describe their plan to their followers. Jimjar approves, saying they should "Do unto others before they have a chance to do unto us," which Zap recognizes as a teaching of the gnome god of illusions, Baravar Cloakshadow.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MOON</span> <span class="caps">ELF</span> ON <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RUN</span><br>
With Zimmerl's aid, Yzak is able to successfully plot a course. Four hours in, Yzak beaches his boat when he sees a female form lying prostrate on the shore. He soon finds it to be a bedraggled moon elf maiden with broken manacles on her wrists. With the aid of Stool's spores, everyone is able to converse. The elf, whose name is Amra, claims she hails from the magical city of Silverymoon in the surface world, but was captured by drow raiders and enslaved in Menzoberranzan for a couple of months before a thirty-foot tall, two-headed demon with tentacles for arms rampaged through the city, giving her a chance to escape in the chaos. She has been on the run in the Underdark ever since (several tendays), and all of her companions have met grisly ends – it is now only her. The duergar Hemeth is suspicious, saying Amra may be one of Maven Delve's coven sisters in disguise, but Zap finds her flesh to be appropriately smooth (and undisguised), and Zimmerl is satisfied with her answer that Taern Hornblade is High Mage of Silverymoon. Amra joins the group for safety, gladly taking a goodberry and some fresh water. Prince Derendil, seeing her refreshed, notices her beauty and proclaims that Hanali Celanil (elf goddess of love) has blessed him, and that Amra shall be his queen when they reach his forest realm. Amra chooses to take passage on a different boat than his.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">REDCAP</span> <span class="caps">AMBUSH</span><br>
A few hours later, the flotilla stops again so that Jagh and Yzak can fish for their dinner (the ranger catching 3 pounds of blind cave fish, the druid 14. As they sit on a small, fungus-covered island, the two are surprised when six "toadstools" reveal themselves to be gnarled, hunched creatures resembling miniature old men. They are redcaps, hateful fey creatures who literally cannot live without committing murder. Normally they live and hunt alone, but sometimes work in groups as mercenaries for hags, receiving payment in the form of victims.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882033/Redcap.PNG?1532149183"><br>
<br>
The redcaps rush forward, swinging their wicked sickles and kicking with heavy iron boots, an onslaught which Jagh falls to. Yzak and Araigne try to hold off the redcaps, but some of the fey clamber aboard the party's boats, dropping Buppido and Araigne as well. Sarith is able to slow their advance with a Darkness spell, and Zap and Yzak skillfully slice apart the evil creatures. Jagh, having been healed by a goodberry Maged Handed to him by Zap, turns into octopus form and dominates the battle with his long, entangling tentacles, killing a couple of the redcaps himself. The final one to fall has a varnished eyeball sewn into his tunic, which Zap recognizes as a Hag Eye – through which the hag coven can see. It also psychically wounds and blinds the coven when it is destroyed – Yzak proposes holding onto this item until the assault on their lair. The party departs, with sixteen hours left to row.</p>

<p>Day Eleven (cont. again) – Hammer 30<br>
<span class="caps">DECEIVING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DECEIVERS</span><br>
After the bloody battle against the redcaps, Shuushar makes the party's agreed-upon gesture to initiate a mental link, quietly informing Zimmerl that, as a kuo-toa, he can sense invisible objects, and that the hag coven has a scrying sensor above the group. Zimmerl and Zap put on an elaborate deception (making up for Shade's lack of acting ability), tricking the hags into thinking that they are lost, then getting back in the boats and rowing off in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes (Scrying's spell duration), the crew lands back at the same spot and sets up camp for a much-needed rest (having battled the corrupted water elemental and its mummy progenitor that morning, scouted Sloobludop while darkmantles attacked camp, learned Buppido's nature, encountered Maven Delve, met Amra the elf slave, and been ambushed by redcaps all in that day). Shuushar asks Shade about his search for enlightenment, explaining that the kuo-toa of Sloobludop believe that by traveling the labyrinth of the Darklake, a great secret will be revealed to their race. Shuushar also speaks to Zimmerl about his mystical training, the drow explaining that he learned the Invisible Art from mind flayers (earning a suspicious look from Zap).</p>
<p>Day Twelve – Midwinter&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RALLYING</span>&nbsp;<br>
During the "night", Sarith confides in Zimmerl that he is having excruciating headaches that have gotten worse every day since leaving Velkynvelve, and that he is starting to believe the murder accusations against him. Zimmerl has little comfort to offer his fellow drow. Before anyone else has risen, Hemeth walks over to Zap's rowboat and takes one of the two severed merrow heads adorning the prow, parading around the camp while chanting in Dwarvish and periodically striking the cavern floor with Eldeth's warhammer. Zimmerl asks the duergar what in the Nine Hells he is doing. Hemeth, bewildered that Zimmerl does not know, says that it is Midwinter Eve, the holiday on which the faithful of Deep Duerra celebrate the Rallying. He explains that his ritual symbolizes that the duergar will seize territory from the merrow before the next Rallying. Awoken by Hemeth's chanting and hammering, the party begins to rise.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SOCIETY</span> OF <span class="caps">BRILLIANCE</span> – <span class="caps">GRAZILLAX</span>&nbsp;<br>
Before anyone can break camp and crew their boats again, there is a flash of light in the middle of camp. When it fades, a seven-foot tall humanoid creature with glistening purple skin and four tentacles dangling around its mouth stands before the group – it is a mind flayer. Hemeth and Sarith instinctively raise their weapons in defense as Stool, Topsy &amp; Turvy flee in terror – the Underdark races know the power of a mind flayer. The mad Buppido and the brash Yzak draw their weapons and charge, the kobold landing a cut on the illithid before it mind blasts them both, bringing them to their knees with psychic pain without so much as a wave of the hand.</p>
<p>Carrying on as if nothing had happened, the illithid speaks into their minds, saying "My name is Grazillax…I remember you." It explains that it is a member of the Society of Brilliance, a five-member party who teleport around the Underdark solving its problems. Grazillax senses that the party is hunting foul members of a foul race, explaining that Nanny Plunk, Maven Delve, and Dame Spiderwort were born of a hag named Granny Gristlegums, who years ago devoured infant triplets after a human slave gave birth on the shores of the Darklake, in turn giving birth to this evil coven. Maven Delve's death should have broken the coven, yet they are still Scrying – Grazillax says that there is a human witch named Peggy Pigknuckle who has been yearning to prove herself to join a coven by spreading plague and acts of depravity, and they must have quickly taken her on to complete the coven.</p>
<p>Their dark origin gives these hags additional powers – Grazillax says that hags build their lairs where the borders between planes are thin, and that their connection to the Feywild will be stronger today (Midwinter) than usual. And yet the illithid also senses they are pursued – it says that if the party stays in camp to wait out Midwinter, Mistress Ilvara's pursuit party will catch them. Grazillax believes the party can destroy the coven, but should beware the deceitfulness of their race and believe nothing they see within their lair. The party asks about Demogorgon and about the Society's own goals; Grazillax asks what year it is and simply says that he "remembers the Rage of Demons," and that the party will understand his party's goals "when they meet," pointing to a time-traveler nature. Wishing them luck but saying he is not here to solve all their problems for them, Grazillax teleports away.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UNSMOOTH</span> <span class="caps">SAILING</span><br>
Deciding to press onward, the party mans their boats. After a few hours nearing the hags' island, "stone teeth" (stalagmites) jutting from the bottom of the tunnel scrape against the bottom of the hulls, with Shade and Shuushar's boat suffering most. After eight hours of rowing, the current has gotten progressively stronger, and in one passage is very rough – the rowboats avoid damage, but the larger keelboat is slammed into the tunnel wall, throwing Jagh and Hemeth overboard. The druid wild-shapes into an octopus midair, catching the duergar arms smuggler – and Eldeth's shield and warhammer – before they are lost in the black waters of the Darklake.</p>
<p>The Darklake perils increase as the flotilla nears the hag lair – two hours later, loose rocks fall from the cavern ceiling, pelting party members and punching holes in the decks of their boats. Shade and Zap's boats are now dangerously rickety, so Jagh leaps from boat to boat, mending holes in the hulls.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HAGS</span>' <span class="caps">LAIR</span>&nbsp;<br>
After sixteen hours of rowing in shifts, the flotilla comes into a larger flooded cavern with a small island in the center. Running aground fifty feet offshore, the heroes decide to use Shade's shadow arts, as the monk channels qi to let them Pass Without Trace, silently slipping into the chilly waters and swimming past a group of fiendish-looking statues on the bottom – statues they believe are kapaocinth (aquatic gargoyles), evil elementals that are cunning swimmers in defiance of their stone bodies.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882037/Gargoyle.jpg?1532150129"></p>
<p>Coming ashore, the party intends to scout out the island before returning to the boats and picking followers for a stealth assault, having declined Prince Derendil's offer to lead a storming of the beach to distract from their approach (but accepting his offer, as a generous leader in the mold of Corellon Larethian, to allow them any plunder they may find in their conquest of the hut.) There is talk of using Zap as an infiltrator disguised as a redcap, or of using all four deep gnomes to approach since the hags cannot divine their presence.</p>
<p>Despite their stealthy intentions, the party puts the hags on guard by deciding to squash the Hag's Eye taken from the redcaps, blinding and psychically wounding the coven within the menacing skull lair looming before them. Wandering Shade runs toward the wails of pain, crossing a fungus-filled field in record time with his feline agility, dodging an exploding boomshroom patch in the meantime. Jagh slowly makes his way overland in octopus form as the others run to join their comrade. At the skull hut's mouth/door, Shade sees Nanny Plunk within, rummaging blindly through cupboards as her sister Dame Spiderwort sharpens her teeth on a millstone, and Peggy Pigknuckle stumbling around complaining that she did not join the coven for this.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884090/Skull_Lair.PNG?1532757906"></p>
<p>Running in to attack, Shade is surprised when the carpet itself lifts off the floor, wrapping around his head to try and smother him. As the others join the attack, they quickly find that "Plunk" and "Spiderwort" are actually illusions. The real hags appear, walking <strong>through</strong> the stairs they were hiding under. Plunk calls on the coven power to cast a Lightning Bolt that badly wounds Shade, and Spiderwort throws a mummified toad into the bubbling cauldron at the hut's center, casting the entire hut into a cloud of Darkness to bring the heroes down to the hags' level of blindness. A crossbow bolt from Yzak coated in drow sleeping poison puts Peggy Pigknuckle out of commission almost immediately.</p>
<p>The hags fight with everything in their power, but that power is severely reduced by their blindness, being unable to use Eyebite, Hold Person, Polymorph, Phantasmal Killer, Vicious Mockery, and other spells. Relying on their Midwinter-only lair powers to walk through walls and to create illusory copies of themselves, the green hags do their best to defend their lair and cause pain to the heroes, but fail even in casting Bestow Curse against the heroes' strong wills. Jagh, finally reaching the hut, turns back into half-orc form to heal the wounded Shade. With a howling wind, the hut's doors and windows slam shut, locking Jagh and Zimmerl outside, but the half-orc Jagh is able to smash through the door with a shoulder ram. After taking a grievous blow from Yzak, Dame Spiderwort falls to her knees and begs for her wretched life, the blind hag promising dark knowledge in exchange for mercy. The kobold cuts off her head. Zap, meanwhile, tears the rug of smothering apart with his shortsword.</p>
<p>The coven now truly broken, and now fighting alone, Nanny Plunk smashes a mirror on her knee to create a Cloud of Daggers and flees through the wall, leaving an illusory duplicate behind. This double begs Yzak for mercy, offering a potion and magical dust in exchange, but when Yzak attacks anyway, these items clatter to the floor. Zap runs outside and knocks the fleeing hag unconscious just as Yzak did to Peggy.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882039/Hag_Lair.PNG?1532150333"></p>
<p>Outside the hut, the party sees that their friends are under attack by the kapaocinth and the twisted terrain of the hags' island itself – some struggle in the shallow water against the gargoyles, as others on land are caught in quicksand or ensnared by vines snaking through the undergrowth. Topsy and Turvy, the secretive and suspicious deep gnome twins, run to hide in the bole of a tree, but are cornered by a kapaocinth. Meanwhile on the surface world, the Midwinter moon turns its cycle, and the two reveal their secret nature as wererats as they twist and turn into lycanthrope form. The party rushes to their aid, and after glancing blows against its stone form the gargoyle's head is smashed in by a crushing blow from Jagh (now in bear form).</p>
<p>Looking furtively at the heroes, Topsy and Turvy shift into giant rat form, scurrying away as they fear the group's reaction to their nature. Yzak, Shade, and Zap call out for the twins to stay ("We don't care! We have a serial killer!" Zap pleads in Gnomish), but none are particularly convincing. The twins disappear into a tiny hole in the ground – perhaps their paths will cross the heroes' again. For now, the heroes are left to deal with the unconscious hag and enchantress in their custody before the pursuing drow catch up.<br>

<p><span class="caps">DAY</span> 12 (cont.) – Midwinter&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">AFTER</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TWINS</span><br>
With Topsy and Turvy having fled down a tiny crevice in rat form, fearing their companions' reactions to their lycanthropy, Zap quickly produces one of his 1,000 ball-bearings, which Zimmerl mystically bonds his senses to and rolls down the hole. When he can see the wererats squeezing deeper into the earth, Zimmerl telepathically contacts Topsy, by far the more social of the two, who says that, as a drow, Zimmerl should understand better than anyone what happens when the deep gnomes trust strangers (referring to the fall of Blingdenstone a century ago). Zimmerl is able to convince her that the group means them no harm, and the twins agree to stay with the party as far as Gracklstugh.</p>
<p><span class="caps">KILL</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WITCHES</span>&nbsp;<br>
With the surviving green hag Nanny Plunk and her human coven-mate Peggy Pigknuckle incapacitated, the heroes decide to have Derendil toss Peggy headfirst into Glabagool's gelatinous form, which quickly dissolves the enchantress as she awakens from her poisoned sleep. Yzak finishes off Nanny Plunk despite her bargaining for her life by claiming the heroes won't be able to use the magic stolen from her without her dark knowledge.</p>
<p>Glabagool asks why the party was "mean" to the hags when they were nice to the gnomes, and the heroes explain that the hags were trying to kill them. Thus the ooze learns morality by their hand. Jimjar also asks Zap about Topsy &amp; Turvy before they are back, asking if they had never revealed their lycanthropy during his childhood; Zap says that they left the village a few years ago and became hermits.</p>
<p>After Yzak and Zap conceal the remaining boomshroom patches around the island to cause trouble for the pursuing drow, Zap, Sarith, and Zimmerl search the hags' hut for any further treasures. Upstairs, they find a rusting iron cage holding a sickly bat with clipped wings, which seems to be capable of making only one sound: the roar of a lion. Additionally, there is a thick tome, its pages filled with tiny, barely-legible writing in Sylvan. Yzak takes the bat-cage, and the party takes the book as well, hoping to translate it at a later time.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MARKING</span> <span class="caps">MIDWINTER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Before boarding the boats and making way toward Gracklstugh, Jimjar takes Zap and the twins aside, saying that since it's Midwinter it is the svirfneblin god Callarduran Smoothhands's holiday the Feast of the Star. He prays for Callarduran to protect and hide them from the drow and other Underdark dangers, and to reveal the hidden treasures of the earth. He then takes a handful of specially-bred phosphorescent fungi hidden on his person, tossing it into the Darklake, where it lights up like stars, creating an illusion of the night sky reflected in the waters below, reaffirming the deep gnomes' ties with the surface world and reassuring them they have not been abandoned.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882080/Calendar_of_Harptos.jpg?1532151620"></p>
<p>Commoners of the North celebrate Deadwinter Day as a marking of the midpoint of the cold season, with hard times still ahead, but some of the worst days now past. Prince Derendil says that it is also a time when nobles renew alliances, and re-asserts his protection of his vassals, the party. He goes on to claim that worshipers of Corellon Larethian like himself take Midwinter dusk to commune with the natural and mystical worlds to gain knowledge against the return of the banished darkness so he might be strong in heart against the corruption of the Spider Queen. Sarith ignores this anti-Lolth invective.</p>
<p>Stool knows nothing of Midwinter, but wants to be part of the group and so takes the chance as they board the boats to fire off rapport spores and loudly thank its god Psilofyr for its new friends and wishing to return to Neverlight Grove. Perhaps they would like to gather in a "circle" as in myconid society and form a Circle of Adventurers? None of the party seems particularly amenable. As they row away, Buppido prays in Dwarvish to Diirinka to kill his enemies and grant him knowledge, but Zap intuits that this is lip-service meant to throw off the party, since Buppido believes himself to be the avatar of Diinkarazan, Diirinka's brother.</p>

<span class="caps">DAY</span> 13 – 1 Alturiak</p>
<p><span class="caps">SCRAG</span> <span class="caps">ATTACK</span>!<br>
With Yzak's rowboat taking point, the kobold is surprised to see a massive form surging forward out of the dark waters ahead. Bursting out with a spray, standing waist-deep in the six-foot water, is a scrag – an aquatic troll. As much a mindless engine of destruction as a standard troll, the scrag uses its great strength to flip over Yzak's boat, spilling he, Araigne, Sarith, and Buppido into the water. Though the troll is easy to strike, it can take a great deal of punishment, and heals its wounds as long as it is immersed in water. Zimmerl implants a thought that the Darklake is made of magma, but, amazingly, the scrag is done in by a bolt with drow sleeping poison fired by Yzak. As it dreams nightmares of sleeping in lava, the troll is pulled out of the water by Derendil, and with it on deck, the party asks Glabagool to dissolve it. The ooze starts at the scrag's feet, working its way up the deck until it reaches the scrag's head, which rolls over toward Jagh, reflexively biting as it goes. The half-orc picks up the troll head and drop-kicks it into Glabagool, watching it dissolve in the cube.<br>

<p><span class="caps">DUERGAR</span> <span class="caps">PROSPECTORS</span><br>
Hours later, as Jagh scouts ahead of the boats in his octopus form, he comes upon a keelboat adrift on the current, headed their way. Though the boat seems un-crewed, his keenly-trained druidic senses pick up the sound of breathing coming from aboard. He telepathically relays this to Zimmerl, who relays the info. Zap posits that, given that the duergar of Gracklstugh use the Darklake for trade and can go invisible, it could be one of their ships. Glabagool, using its blindsense, confirms there are five humanoids aboard. After Zimmerl shouts down the tunnel in Undercommon for them to reveal themselves, the duergar reluctantly do so, approaching for parley. They are armed with war picks and javelins, and seem ready for battle, but their captain addresses Hemeth in Dwarvish, ignoring the non-duergar Zimmerl. Hemeth says that he was betrayed in Sloobludop by the Clan Ironhead merchants he was with and sold to the kuo-toa, but was rescued by the heroes before he could be sacrificed to "Leemoogoogoon." The captain says this is appropriate, since "lesser races" should aid their betters. Wanting to know more, Zimmerl cuts into the conversation, asking the captain his own business. The captain is annoyed at the drow's intrusion and tries to psionically charm him, but Zimmerl resists. The captain explains he is of Clan Xornbane, Gracklstugh's scouts and prospectors, and is bound for the city with a cargo of iron ore. Zimmerl goes on to psionically compel a truthful answer to the question "Were you going to attack us?", to which the captain replies he was going to take them to sell as slaves, but now has no intent to attack since they seem to be a strong company. Speaking telepathically, the party's Harper agents (Yzak and Zap) say they cannot abide slavers, and Jagh agrees. Moreover, they have a keelboat with a hold full of iron ore to add to the party's fleet. Zimmerl is ambivalent, so the heroes have three ayes and an abstention (with Shade in Underdark-sleep).&nbsp;The party decides to become subterranean river pirates.<br>

<p>Launching the attack is Jagh, still in giant octopus form adjacent to the duergar boat, reaches up and grabs one of the crew. Zimmerl, using his newfound air mastery, blasts one overboard, and Yzak and Zap use the others for crossbow practice. Hemeth clambers aboard and makes a beeline for the captain's dying form, raising Eldeth Feldrun's warhammer and smashing his head head like a melon. He stoically turns to the heroes and reminds them to have Jagh drag the man overboard back on deck to loot his gear as well.</p>
<p>Re-configuring their crew manifests, the party commandeers the (unmarked) Clan Xornbane keelboat and heads back to its home port, intent on selling its riches for their own good.</p>

<p>Day 13 (cont.) – Alturiak 1<br>
As the group rows through the Darklake, Zimmerl implants one of his psionic sensors on a low-hanging stalactite, mentally sensing a couple of hours later that Mistress Ilvara and her pursuit party are hot on their heels, perhaps now driven on their chase by some mad obsession to catch them. Yzak again floats the notion of ambushing the drow, but Zimmerl and Zap oppose it, so the group moves on.</p>

<span class="caps">DUERGAR</span> <span class="caps">DEMOLITION</span> <span class="caps">CREW</span><br>
After an uninterrupted 24 hours of rowing in shifts, the ranger Yzak detects the presence of humanoids in the cavern ahead. Swimming stealthily ahead, Yzak hears the roar of a waterfall – but feels no current pulling him onward. Going on, he sees this is because a lock and dam have been constructed here, and he sees five duergar with picks and hammers doing some sort of labor. Receiving the kobold's telepathic report via Zimmerl, Jagh goes forward in octopus form, hearing the duergar crew leader instructing his men that the lock here was built by the shield dwarves of the lost kingdom of Ammarindar, and that the Deepking wanted them destroyed so that they could be replaced with "superior duergar craftsmanship."<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882085/Duergar_Warriors.jpg?1532152992"></p>
<p>Realizing that if the duergar demolish the lock their boats would be swept down the waterfall, the party quickly rows forward, making no effort at stealth. Their duergar companion Hemeth the arms smuggler speaks for the group again, but even when he offers to pay the duergar to let them through and then quickly finish their work before the drow arrive, the leader refuses to pause in his task. As the party attacks the obstinate gray dwarves, all of the opposing duergar go invisible. Following footprints in the gravel and calling on the aid of Glabagool's blindsight, the group still targets the duergar with some accuracy, attacking this group much like the last duergar encountered. Yzak and Zap fire their crossbows remorselessly, Zimmerl shows off his new air mastery, and Jagh uses his long-reaching tentacles to great effect. The fight is not without cost, however, as Yzak's spider companion Araigne is smashed by a hammer blow from an enlarged enemy duergar.</p>
<p>Examining the duergar corpses, Hemeth finds the sigil of Clan Steelshadow – the royal clan – on the leader, as well as a King's Knife, which marks him as a member of the Deepking's personal knights, the Stone Guard. Zap investigates the lock, and after determining its workings, operates the mechanism to fill it with water so the party's boats can descend the 60-ft waterfall. He also sabotages it to slow the pursuing drow, and etches a note for any other agents of Gracklstugh, saying "actually a duergar lock."</p>

<br>
Five hours after the duergar encounter, in the wee morning, the party is jostled awake by increasingly rough currents, bashing their boats against the cavern walls. Yzak, Topsy, and Shuushar are thrown overboard, where they find a school of eight murderous ixitxachitl. Half the demon rays attack the overboard adventurers, while the others gnaw at the vulnerable bottom of the group's rowboat. Their leader, a cleric of Demogorgon, casts Create Water above the boat, threatening to sink it as gallons of putrid liquid appear in the air and splash within. Jagh summons a swarm of quippers (piranha-like fish) from the Elemental Plane of Water to aid, which prove devastatingly effective before the druid loses his concentration on the spell. The ixitxachitl cleric quickly falls to a hail of crossbow bolts, and Zap is able to use Tasha's Hideous Laughter on one ixitxachitl, causing it to spin in an endless barrel roll as its fellows are slaughtered. The demon rays are killed before they can sink the rowboat, and the heroes row toward Gracklstugh as fast as they can, knowing the drow are close at hand.</p>

"Iä! Iä! <span class="caps">CTHULHU</span> <span class="caps">FHTAGN</span>!"&nbsp;<br>
In the early "morning", while navigating through a passageway with "stone teeth" protruding through the waterline, the waterborne adventurers pass by a broken, barnacle-encrusted statue of an alien god. When four kuo-toa wriggle out of a small tunnel, both groups are caught unaware. The whip leading the kuo-toa declares that his god, Great Cthulhu, demands their deaths. Shade hops out to join battle, fighting the whip as Zimmerl kills all the others with a strong blast of air. With the kuo-toa dead, Shade explores the rowboat they had hidden among the fungi – flipping it over, he finds its fishing nets full of stirges, which flitter out and attempt to suck his blood before they are easily killed. Shade refuses to examine the Cthulhu statue, but the others salvage it to sell in Gracklstugh.<br>
<br>

That afternoon, the boats find themselves in rough current, and after a collision against the cavern wall, Sarith, Jimjar, and Amra are all thrown overboard – Amra screams that there is something in the water, and she is pulled below. Zap jumps into the water but finds that the runaway elf slave girl is already dead, a swarm of quippers biting at her flesh. Jimjar signals upward that they should get out of the water and swims to safety, but Zap remains, stabbing the swarm one fish at a time. Zimmerl uses his air blast on the carnivorous fish, and Sarith appears out of the dark water, attacking as well – but when Zap takes his first wound, Sarith immediately abandons him to the quippers' blood frenzy, swimming back to the surface. Shade jumps in as well, and soon enough the heroes have defeated these hungry fish. Zimmerl fishes Amra's corpse from the black waters and mystically restores her to life before her soul leaves the Material Plane, receiving a crushing bear hug from Derendil in thanks for saving his beauteous "bride-to-be."<br>

A few hours later, while Yzak and Jagh are off foraging, Buppido takes the chance to regale the crew with a story he learned in his hometown, Gracklstugh. He tells the tale of a derro who was fired for thieving from his employer, but then got his revenge by conspiring with his boss's debtors to murder him, thus showing – in Buppido's mind – that everything works according to "the Great Plan." Hemeth complains that the many misfortunes which have befallen the group disprove that anything is in accordance with some cosmic will, but Buppido scoffs and says the duergar couldn't possibly understand.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SERVANT</span> OF <span class="caps">DARKNESS</span><br>
As the party scratches their heads regarding the moral of Buppido's story, a rowboat with a lone, cloaked figure aboard rounds a bend, headed their way. Zimmerl calls for the boatman to stop; he reveals himself to be a duergar. Zap and Zimmerl notice his facial tattoo which marks him as a calassabrak ("the flawed who aren't to be trusted"), outcast from duergar society. He introduces himself as Bruthwol Burakrinwurn, and says he is headed to Gracklstugh despite being banished. The party notes two flaws with this: that he is headed in the wrong direction, and that he will be killed if he returns. Bruthwol thanks them for the directions, but giggles and implies that it is not he who will be killed should he return.</p>
<p>As Bruthwol is about to row toward Gracklstugh, Zap casually warns him that Demogorgon is on the loose in the Underdark and rampaged through Sloobludop. Bruthwol seems pleased by this, saying it is "in accordance with his master's plan." His master is a powerful balor named Errtu, who along with Lolth herself arranged for the destruction of Zimmerl's kin of House Oblodra.&nbsp;&nbsp;The group quickly goes from thinking Bruthwol is not their problem and a potential ally to thinking he should probably be destroyed. The mad warlock's command of hellfire nearly destroys the heroes: his Scorching Rays, Hellish Rebuke, and even a Wall of Fire cast in his own rowboat against Zap and Shade badly burn the heroes, and his own unnatural defenses seem to prolong the punishment he can withstand. He seems to giggle and cackle more and more as his situation becomes more serious. Finally, through superior numbers the party is able to kill Bruthwol and move on.</p>

<span class="caps">BETWEEN</span> A <span class="caps">ROCK</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> A <span class="caps">GRELL</span><br>
After navigating their boats across a powerful whirlpool, the party comes to a tight passage, where the middle boat of the formation gets stuck between the walls. As the crew gets out to push the boat out, Zap notices a pair of floating, beaked, tentacled brains hovering just below the cavern ceiling. Araigne and Shade scramble up the rock walls, bringing the fight to the grells as Zap causes one to twirl in bemusement with Tasha's Hideous Laughter, and Zimmerl fills one with self-doubt with his Ego Whip. Set up for a coup de grace, Shade leaps off the wall and delivers the kill stroke, landing gracefully on the keelboat deck below. With the grells dead, Yzak harvests their paralytic poisoin, and the party decides to leave the zurkhwood raft they constructed six or seven days prior to block the narrow passage, slowing Ilvara Mizzrym and her drow.<br>

Coming out of a low-ceilinged cavern, the party finally see the imposing City of Blades, capital of the Deepkingdom. Overlake Hold, a fortress-temple carved out of a huge stalagmite bristling with catapults and chimneys, looms over the Darklake docks, guarding Gracklstugh from amphibious assault. A cloud of smog lies low over the city, and the endless din of hammers echoes throughout the cavern as the gray dwarves toil in the name of their grim god Laduguer. Hemeth and Buppido agree that the easternmost pier is secluded enough from the law to be a safe landing point, so the party's flotilla rows that way. Duergar overseers and some goblin slaves lash their boats to the pier, one of them ordering Buppido to help, and confusedly asking why the heroes would allow a derro to bear arms.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882105/Gracklstugh.PNG?1532159512"></p>
<p>Having berthed their boats, the party begins to follow Hemeth's advice to find lodging at the Gholbrorn's Lair, the only inn in town to host foreigners, the arms smuggler declaring that as soon as they have rooms his life-debt to them is paid. As they pass by the next pier over, they see a duergar merchant standing by himself suddenly attacked by masked soulblades who appear out of thin air, glowing blades of pure energy sprouting from their fists. Zap and Zimmerl recognize these as the Forak-Erach-Naek ("Empty-Scabbard Killers"), a legendary order of psionic assassins-for-hire. Zap elects not to interfere with the workings of a "legitimate business," and the heroes allow the merchant to be murdered. The assassins rush away and disappear into the crowd, and Zimmerl rushes ahead, using his Restore Life power on the freshly-dead merchant just as he did with Amra. Topsy, standing watch on the street corner, shouts that a guard patrol is on the way, and the group dashes to the nearby Gholbrorn's Lair.</p>
<p>IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GHOLBRORN</span>'S <span class="caps">LAIR</span><br>
The inn, dug into the rock beneath the Blade Bazaar, is a cramped, damp and uncomfortable place. The merchant introduces himself as Werz Saltbaron, grudgingly paying the dour innkeeper for the party to stay the night and have a round of Darklake Stout. Going down a twisting tunnel to their spartan accommodations, Shuushar detects invisible creatures everywhere around them, and Glabagool blocks off the tunnel as they hold palaver. Werz claims he has no idea who would have hired assassins against him, but pays the heroes each with a small gemstone in meager thanks, saying he will meet them at midday tomorrow at the Shattered Spire, a tavern here in the Darklake District, where he plans to reward them more properly. As Glabagool allows Werz his passage to leave the room, Shade notices that Buppido is missing. Before anyone can react to this news, Shuushar shouts out that an invisible creature is in the room with them, pointing at the end of one of the beds. Zimmerl's Faerie Fire reveals the outline of a duergar female, who uses her racial Enlarge, but is quickly put out of commission by Shade. The party ties up this skulking gray dwarf and prepares for interrogation. Having been in the City of Blades for only a few minutes, they already have been drawn into a web of mystery and intrigue.</p>

The duergar spy captured in the room at the inn quickly reveals herself to be Brilmara, a maid who was trying to guard herself against thievery by practicing her own larcenous skill on her guests. She says the proprietor, Murghol Muzgardt, is her uncle, but honestly says that if she were not good enough to avoid being caught, he would say she deserves her fate at the hands of the heroes. Glabagool says that, according to how the Darklake hags were dealt with, she should be dissolved. Accepting death, Brilmara is surprised when Yzak asks if she has anything worth her own life. The gray dwarf says that she will get them a keg of Darklake Stout – Clan Muzgardt's specialty and the lifeblood of Gracklstugh, a city short on clean water. Zap insists a contract be drawn up, which Zimmerl writes out in Dwarvish.</p>
<p>Murghol is cross with his niece, telling Brilmara that if she is going to steal from his guests to at least be good at it, and that he will give the heroes the ale, but she will work without wages for the next two weeks. He didn't lose a hand to the bulette whose head hangs above the bar and watch his kin die at its hands to go giving away kegs of ale to foreigners. As Murghol starts serving the heroes, he turns invisible, continuing on as if nothing is amiss. Zimmerl asks him several times why he did this, and when his questions go unheeded, psionically demands a truthful answer. Murghol snaps to his senses, saying he had no idea he'd used his racial psionic power and returning to the visible spectrum.<br>

<p>Meanwhile Hemeth the arms smuggler, having repaid the heroes for saving him from the kuo-toa Leemoogoogoon cult by bringing them here, lays down the arms of the late Eldeth Feldrun and leaves the party. Before walking out of the inn, he speaks to Zimmerl, saying that as a Deep Duerra worshipper, he recognizes the strength of psionics, and believes drow and duergar should stand together against illithid domination of the Underdark. Hemeth arranges to meet Zimmerl in the common room here at midnight to share psionic secrets, and goes on his way.<br>

Having dealt with the assassination of Werz Saltbaron and the larceny of the maid Brilmara, the party leaves their rooms at the Gholbrorn's Lair to go about their stated business in the City of Blades: commerce. The first order of business is walking back to the docks and selling the fleet that bore them across the Darklake. Arriving, they find a Stoneguard named Gorglak eyeing their boats. He asks their business and calls them liars before they respond, demanding they add something to his collection of fine weapons in order to avoid arrest. Sarith whispers that duergar are rarely so openly corrupt as this Gorglak. Jagh agrees to give the Stoneguard a pair of gems (cursed ones found in the mummy sarcophagus) instead of a weapon, but Gorglak does not take the gems on the spot, quietly telling the half-orc he is being too open about this as they stand on the pier. Gorglak loudly announces that the inspection has been satisfactory, and as he leaves he whispers that the party should bring his bribe to his contact in the docks – none other than Werz Saltbaron. They should find Werz tomorrow around midday at the Shattered Spire tavern, he says, and if he finds they have not passed along the gems by the end of his shift, Gorglak will muster the Stoneguard to find and arrest them.&nbsp;<br>
Before the duergar leaves, Zap uses Mage Hand to steal his King's Knife, the honored blade of the Stoneguard, hiding it on the underside of the pier.<br>

<p><span class="caps">MERCHANT</span> <span class="caps">MADNESS</span> AT <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>&nbsp;<br>
After selling the boats to the dock officials of Clan Burakinwurn, Jagh decides to make extra money by taking the unrefined iron ore plundered from the Clan Xornbane prospectors to that very clan's refinery, working there himself the rest of the day rather than leave it to their slaves. Through Jagh's labor, the party gains 200 GP rather than 100 for the ore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yzak, Zimmerl, and Zap go to the Blade Bazaar, the central market of the Darklake District (the only part of the city openly accessible to foreigners). The very first merchant they try to unload gems and jewelry onto constantly changes his offering price, claiming it is the heroes who are changing their terms. When they finally get the 1,000 GP they want, the mad merchant gives them a cracked ruby that is worth that much to duergar since it symbolizes their superiority over other dwarven subraces, but only 250 GP elsewhere. Unsatisfied, Zimmerl takes this to another merchant who screams at him to take 800 GP or die, but soon enough work out a more equitable arrangement. Zap meanwhile finds another merchant who insults him endlessly while he is trying to sell, but becomes a picture of politeness when he is trying to buy. Zimmerl and Zap finally think they have found a reasonable merchant when they find one offering to sell them a Sword of Vengeance; it turns out this weapon is possessed by a vengeful spirit and will curse the bearer into only attacking those who most recently attacked him. The merchant consults his invisible brother – who may or may not actually be there – and says he will gladly sell them cursed weapons and armor at discount prices. Yzak theorizes that the dual nature of Gracklstugh – physically divided by Laduguer's Rift, and socially by the rift between duergar and derro – has made the city susceptible to madness by the presence of the dual-headed Demogorgon in the Underdark.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DEEP</span> <span class="caps">GNOME</span> <span class="caps">MERCHANT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Sick of dealing with mad duergar, Zap approaches a deep gnome merchant named Ariana. As her earth elemental bodyguard stands behind her, Ariana looks at the three travelers and assumes they are smugglers, opening a Bag of Holding and showing Zap ten sparkling garnets she is trying to quickly unload. The svirfneblin make their clandestine deal, Zap hoping to sell them for a profit.</p>
<p><span class="caps">YLSA</span>'S <span class="caps">DEAL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Ylsa Henstak, a member of a grocering clan and Gracklstugh's Merchant Council, approaches the characters in the crowded market and says they look like capable foreigners, a demographic the Merchant Council often looks for as caravan guards. She invites them into her well-guarded office on the edge of the Blade Bazaar with a small job in mind for them. She reveals a small hoard of coins and jewelry, and says all of these items come from the strange lands of the surface world. All of these treasures, she claims, she has traced to the derro, who have used them to pay for food. If the heroes can figure out where the derro are getting surface currency, Ylsa will provide directions for routes to the surface world, Blingdenstone, or other parts of the Underdark, and may also be willing to sponsor their presence in other quarters of the city.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DERRO</span> <span class="caps">COURIER</span>&nbsp;<br>
While going to Ylsa's office, Yzak noticed a derro darting between the stalls and shops of the Blade Bazaar. Dressed in rags styled as a fancy jacket and wearing a wide-brimmed hat with two displacer beast tentacles sewn into the crown, the derro weaves through the crowd with impressive speed, muttering to himself and constantly looking into a large satchel. While Zap and Zimmerl go speak with Ylsa, Yzak looks down from the small plateau the Blade Bazaar is upon (and the Gholbrorn's Lair is carved within), seeing that the derro is already 200 ft away, headed toward a gate out of the Darklake District. The derro melts into the crowd before the ranger can follow him, but Yzak marks him for future interest.<br>

Visible to all in the city, an obese red dragon 30 feet long soars over the city in a lazy circle, surveying all in its domain. Flying over the Darklake District and past the Hold of the Deepking with a few flaps of his powerful wings, the dragon lands in the royal Clan Steelshadow hold, and there is a bright flash as he begins his regular rounds lighting the forges of the City of Blades. The wyrmsmith makes his presence felt even in his most mundane of acts.</p>

Meeting up again, the three return to down below into the Gholbrorn's Lair again, content to wait for Jagh's return from the Xornbane refinery and Zimmerl's midnight meeting with Hemeth. On the way out of the bazaar, Zap buys a piece of fish-skin parchment, and casts Prestidigitation to write a message in Undercommon: "<span class="caps">GORGLAK</span> <span class="caps">LOST</span> <span class="caps">HIS</span> <span class="caps">SWORD</span>." Casting Mage Hand, Zap dangles this in front of a pair of guards, who snatch it out of the air. One announces he is going to either kill Gorglak himself, or the derro troublemaker who forged this libel. Zap scurries away back to the inn to have a pint of Darklake Stout and wait for the night's events.</p>

One of them asks if there are any musicians in this grim city; the drum-proficient Jagh is still slaving in Clan Xornbane's ore refinery, so Zap casts Prestidigitation to create the faint sound of music, earning a gold coin from the drow. At this point a noble Lolth priestess and her 4 quaggoth slaves emerge from a passage to their rooms. The priestess, Quavthrae Faen Tlabbar, asks Zimmerl why he is associating with such multiracial rabble. Zimmerl knows that House Faen Tlabbar, though dangerous as the most zealous Lolth priestesses in Menzoberranzan, are also currently political rivals of the slavers of House Mizzrym. Zimmerl lets it be known that they are on the run from Ilvara Mizzrym, and Priestess Quavthrae decides to use the heroes as pawns against her rivals. She tells them that a Mizzrym ally, a scout named Xalith Masq'il'yr, has been eyeing the Blade Bazaar recently for someone in the crowd – perhaps the heroes and their motley crew.<br>

<p>Sarith Kzekarit, who has been in his rented room with a terrible migraine, stumbles into the common room begging Quavthrae to accept his loyal service and cure his headaches, and to provide asylum from Ilvara so she does not sacrifice him. Quavthrae responds she does not know if he is innocent, and she would not want to rob Lolth of a good sacrifice. With that, the emissary and her entourage leave the inn to head for Menzoberranzan.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>: <span class="caps">INCITING</span> <span class="caps">RIOT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Armed with Quavthrae's intelligence, Zimmerl &amp; Zap go outside and scan the crowd, quickly finding Xalith and her scouts. Murghol Muzgardt tells them that simply attacking the drow may not be the best option, but tricking them into damaging merchants' property or leaving the Darklake District could get them arrested and enslaved. Further, the drow won't want to publicly confront their runaway "lost property" since recapturing them would likely involve paying the duergar a reward to aid in their recapture, so Xalith will likely just report to Ilvara on their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Zimmerl telepathically implants an urge in Xalith to run through the nearest merchant with her shortsword. Meanwhile Zap Mage Hands a necklace from a merchant's stall into her belt pouch. Though Xalith easily kills the duergar with her poisoned sword, the drow stand little chance when every duergar guard, merchant, and customer at the Bazaar uses their Enlarge power and converge upon them. Xalith's men draw their weapons in desperation, killing a couple of duergar before they are brought down by the weight of numbers and sheer brawn of their foes. Xalith is taken alive and dragged by an Enlarged guard toward Overlake Hold for interrogation; Zap decides to Mage Hand the necklace back out of her belt pouch after all. Goblin slaves are put to work scrubbing away the blood as the Bazaar is closed for the day.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GHOHLBRORN</span>'S <span class="caps">LAIR</span>: <span class="caps">ORC</span> <span class="caps">MERCENARIES</span><br>
Going back to relaxing at the inn, the party is interrupted by fellow patrons when 5 orcs bearing the sigil of the Many-Arrows tribe come into the common room, barely getting through the language barrier with Murghol without breaking into a rage. The lead orc, an Eye of Gruumsh named Snaglak Spineripper, swaggers over to Wandering Shade and says he and his men have taken a job from the Merchant Council as caravan guards, saying they leave for faraway Skullport in the morning, and that he doubts Shade has what it takes to join them. He says that his crew has an opening since they got rid of "an orc from another tribe" who had been with them, hinting they are the same Many-Arrows orcs the party glimpsed near the Oozing Temple, and that they betrayed Ront. Shade shows saintly patience with Snaglak's provocations, declining his challenges to display his strength, so the orc turns to Zap. The arcane trickster deflects Snaglak's insults with humor, and the orcs are about to go to bed still spoiling for a fight when Yzak asks if they can read his insults of Gruumsh or if they are as stupid as they look.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882112/Orc_Raider.PNG?1532161411"></p>
<p>Snaglak casts Spiritual Weapon, summoning a spear to smite Yzak and using his own physical spear against Shade before being blinded by Zimmerl. The other orcs draw greataxes and try to cleave the heroes in twain. Zap snipes from behind the bar and assassinates an orc who vaults over it to search for him, while Shade deals out lethal blows with his spear to the blind cleric Snaglak. Meanwhile Murghol Muzgardt flees toward the door to summon the guard, but is stymied by an illusory wall created by Zap. The group gathers to convince the innkeeper not to do this, trying to bribe him (which he physically backs away from), and trying to blackmail him (threatening to report his earlier encouragement of extralegal means). He says he will report their activities and accept the Stoneguard's judgments upon him. Furthermore, he suggests the party give Yzak up to the Stoneguard, saying they can always buy his freedom out of slavery after the mandatory year-and-a-day penance. Finally, a last-ditch intimidation cows him for now, and he says he will report that he rallied the heroes to bring peace to his inn against the rowdy orcs.</p>

At midnight, Zimmerl is sitting alone in the common room when Hemeth arrives for their rendezvous. The "arms smuggler" reveals that, in truth, he is a member of the Darkhafts, the Deepking's secret corps of psionic agents. Hemeth gets Zimmerl to agree that gray dwarf and dark elf should stand against mind flayer domination of the Underdark, and that to do this order must be brought to the drow cities to form a firm alliance. He says that he has had an eye on Zimmerl's psionic potential, and thinks he could be a powerful weapon for the Deepking in Menzoberranzan. Zimmerl is intrigued by Hemeth's talk of a psionic Darkhaft academy, but declines his demand to leave the party to undergo spy training in Gracklstugh. Hemeth sighs, saying that now Zimmerl must be eliminated, since if he does not stand with Gracklstugh, he may one day stand against it. A fellow Darkhaft comes out of invisibility as he uses Enlarge on himself. Zimmerl kills Hemeth instantly with a mind blast, and bursts the other Darkhaft's head with an overkill blast, but not before he screams into the streets for aid. Rapidly rallying the party, Zimmerl has Glabagool dissolve the bloodstains and take the corpses into his body, hiding in one of the rooms as Zap casts the illusion of a dresser in front of him. Several guards come into the room, but after a thorough investigation are satisfied that the disturbance must have been somewhere else.</p>
<p>As Araigne senses there is an invisible creature in the room, the party banters on, pretending to go about their business. As Zap tells a tale of his youth as a gemcutter's apprentice, a familiar face enters the front door: Buppido. Zap asks the derro serial killer where he has been, to which he responds he has been creating a Great Path for his people to follow to greatness. Zap asks how he has been doing that, and Buppido says "Like this!" and zaps Zap with a Lightning Bolt. Yzak fires his crossbows in response, and "Buppido" disappears into mist. Yzak runs into the street to search for the derro, who must be nearby casting illusions, but the trail has already gone cold.</p>
<p>The maid Brilmara defies the party's expectations, becoming visible behind the bar as Yzak returns (they had expected a Stoneguard). She says that three times now the party has brought war to their inn, and they will no longer be welcome after tonight. Prince Derendil laments that the traitorous Hemeth and Buppido were the ones who brought them here to this stinking city of industry, and longs for the sun-dappled glades of his surface world kingdom. Wondering why they still remain here, he invokes Labelas Enoreth, elven god of time, to grant them wisdom in the moment of decision. Zap reminds him he should get used to dwarven cities to prepare for his time in the court of King Bruenor Battlehammer when they visit Gauntlgrym, and the quaggoth/elf thanks the gnome for his wisdom.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DAY</span> 18 – Alturiak 6<br>
<span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>: <span class="caps">GORGLAK</span> <span class="caps">SEPPUKU</span><br>
Upon awakening, Sarith, Amra, Jimjar, and Derendil cough up black phlegm – a symptom of grackle-lung, brought on by the smog belching from the many chimneys and forges around the City of Blades. After Murghol cooks up mushroom &amp; rothé cheese omelettes washed down with Darklake Stout in the morning, the party heads up to the Blade Bazaar to check on orders made the previous day. On the way to picking up Zimmerl's magical studded leather, the group witness Gorglak, the corrupt Stoneguard, standing before a group of his fellows. Their officer announces that, though Gorglak found his stolen King's Knife on the underside of the pier, the stain of dishonor must be removed with blood. Gorglak drives the shortsword into his own gut, disemboweling himself to atone for this failing. Zap feels accomplished in turning the honor of the Deepking's minions against them with his arcane trickery.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MEETING</span> <span class="caps">WERZ</span> AT <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SHATTERED</span> <span class="caps">SPIRE</span>&nbsp;<br>
After selling numerous weapons, armor pieces, gems, art pieces, and extraneous magic items at the Bazaar, it is time to meet Werz Saltbaron at the Shattered Spire tavern. Beating him into this mushroom-stalk bar built on a broken stalagmite sticking out of the Darklake, the party orders a round of fiercely hot liquor distilled in house using the pale orange lichen that grows around the stalagmite's thermal vents. Declining the mushroom-and-rothé steak stew seasoned with the same, Shade orders some freshly-baked sporebread with a spicy spread made of the stuff. Werz Saltbaron arrives alone and beckons them to a corner table, where he tells them that to thank them for saving his life, he is giving the heroes a job: to take a sack of raw gemstones to a svirfneblin in Blingdenstone named Kazook Pickshine, no questions asked. Zap, Jimjar, Topsy &amp; Turvy recognize the name but don't know him intimately: the Pickshines are the most influential family of the Blingdenstone Miners' Guild, the most powerful organization in the deep gnome village. Kazook himself is an alchemist and ore specialist, and Werz says Kazook will pay the heroes for the delivery when they bring it to his stall in Blingdenstone's Traders' Grotto. Zap inspects the gemstones, and believes they are empty Spell Gems waiting to be enchanted. Since they know of Kazook and have no concerns regarding him, the party accepts Werz's job without further prying, and the duergar merchant takes his leave.</p>
<p>Immediately after Werz leaves, two duergar patrons stand up and start brawling, with one of them splashing the fire-lichen liquor in the other's eyes. Not wanting to attract any ire from the community, the heroes opt not to interfere in the bar brawl. Both brawlers Enlarge, and after a few blows are thrown, the other patrons and a couple of bouncers rally to return peace to the bar, knocking one out and restraining the other. He claims that he doesn't remember why they started fighting as he is dragged away.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>: <span class="caps">QUIPPER</span> <span class="caps">INCIDENT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Returning again to the Blade Bazaar in keeping with the purpose of their visit, Zap visits the deep gnome merchant Ariana to sell some more art objects. When requested to pour out the dead quippers from the fishtank recovered from the mummy sarcophagus, it is revealed that they are not dead but UNdead, flopping around and biting at merchants' feet. One of the duergar guards on duty Enlarges and stomps the undead fish into oblivion. Yzak asks Ariana where she is lodging since she wasn't among the guests at the Ghohlbrorn's Lair; she says that she is anchoring in the harbor on her boat and sleeping on the Darklake.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>: <span class="caps">ABUSIVE</span> <span class="caps">GUARDS</span><br>
Meanwhile, two guards begin savagely beating one of the duergar merchants, spitting accusations of "heresy" at him as they do. The Dwarvish-speakers of the group catch that they are attacking him for wearing a gold pin on his collar, "adornment for the sake of adornment." Jimjar advises to stay out of this business, though the violence of the guards' response seems unnatural for the lawful duergar. The heroes stand aside at the merchant's abuse as he is beaten into unconsciousness and left on the ground as a reminder to others of the importance of conforming to social norms – along with the corpse of Gorglak a few yards away.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>: <span class="caps">MUREN</span> <span class="caps">XARDELVAR</span>, <span class="caps">LONG</span>-<span class="caps">LOST</span> <span class="caps">RELATION</span><br>
After speaking with Ariana, Zap notices a gray dwarf smiling and waving at him from across the Bazaar. When he waves back, the duergar makes his way through the crowd and excitedly shakes Zap's hand, introducing himself as Muren Xardelvar. He says that he thinks Zap is his long-lost relative, waving off Zap's claim that dwarf and gnome cannot be cousins, and insisting that "Rowsdower" is just the gnomish pronunciation of Xardelvar. Muren insists that Zap &amp; friends come stay the night at his quarters in the Clan Xardelvar gas-mining compound in Laduguer's Furrow. The heroes seem wary of the offer, and make an appointment to meet him again at the Shattered Spire in three hours with no intent to honor it. Muren smiles and takes his leave.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GUESTS</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">STONEGUARD</span>&nbsp;<br>
As they leave the Blade Bazaar, the party is confronted with a squad of 8 duergar warriors and a kavalrachni (cavalryman mounted on a giant tarantula steeder). The kavalrachni accuses Zap of having been seen conversing with a known dealer in stolen property, and says that the entire party is under arrest. Zimmerl asks what the punishment will be; the kavalrachni says there may not be any punishment; first comes the investigation. Any further delay by the heroes will be perceived as resisting arrest – and the entire crowd of duergar merchants and customers turns toward them, indicating they will help detain the party if need be. The party submits to capture, disarming themselves (other than a few hidden weapons on Zap and Yzak that make it past a frisking), except for Topsy &amp; Turvy. The svirfneblin wererat twins turn into giant rat form, scurrying away and hiding in a gutter, evading the pursuing duergar. The kavalrachni angrily demands if the heroes knew they had brought the infectious curse of lycanthropy into Gracklstugh, but Zimmerl is able to bluff that he thought they were druids.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882113/Duergar_Stone_Guard.png?1532161782"></p>
<p>After several hours in the dungeons of Overlake Hold, the temple-fortress that is Gracklstugh's center of government, the heroes are brought up to the office of Captain Errde Blackskull, commander of the Stoneguard. She says that to most of her men, foreigners like the heroes are fit only for enslavement – but she has learned that adventurers have better uses. The Stoneguard has had their eye on a derro courier for some time now by the name of Droki. Despite sometimes seeing Droki in the Darklake District, her patrols have been unable to catch him. They know he lives in the West Cleft District, but this derro ghetto is never entered unless in force, and she fears a strong presence would provoke a riot. So, Captain Blackskull proposes the heroes catch Droki for her alive, or else return with viable information on his activities. Errde's tone turns dark as she suggests Droki is connected to a vast conspiracy involving the derro Council of Savants, saying that the current Deepking's grandfather Tarngardt Steelshadow was manipulated and controlled by the savants, who were the true power in those days. It is only through the vigilance of the Stoneguard and the Keepers of the Flame (the psionic priests who serve Themberchaud the Wyrmsmith) that the derro influence is kept at bay, and she fears they may already control certain lairds of the duergar clans. In order to find Droki's role in the conspiracy, the captain gives each hero a badge emblazoned with the holy symbol of Laduguer which will allow them to travel outside the Darklake District as far south as Laduguer's Furrow when discreetly presented to authorities. Yzak says that the last time they were hired for a job, Demogorgon was summoned, but Errde puts this down to foreigner madness.</p>
<p>This talk of conspiracy leads into discussion of madness and corruption in Gracklstugh on a broader scale, with the heroes describing nearly two dozen examples of strange acts seen among the duergar since arriving barely more than two dozen hours ago. Errde is moved by their tales, and grants them each 350 gp worth of equipment from the Stoneguard armories in order to better succeed in their clandestine mission.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CLOAKED</span> <span class="caps">GUARD</span><br>
While being escorted out of Overlake Hold, a cloaked guard mutters to the heroes that he needs their help. He says that he is Horgar V Steelshadow, Deepking of the Duergar, and he needs the heroes to help him slay the dragon Themberchaud the Wyrmsmith, whom he claims is possessed by a demon lord. To this, Yzak says that he is Laduguer, god of the duergar. The guard nods, saying he has served Laduguer all his life – Yzak claims that for prayers to reach him, the supplicant must stand upon his head, and Horgar seems to buy it. Horgar says that they should find him at the Hold of the Deepking when they are prepared to go on his holy quest. Yzak is interested in this dragonslaying (since his clan were the dragon's slaves/worshipers before being wiped out, he blames Themberchaud for not protecting them), but Shade is very interested in learning more about the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CAPTURING</span> <span class="caps">DROKI</span>&nbsp;<br>
The party splits up to do legwork to find the derro courier Droki. Zap &amp; Zimmerl go to the Gholbrorn's Lair common room to work the rumor mill, plying tongues with free Darklake Stout, and finding Droki is known as a supplier of goods who works for disreputable employers. In the process, they also hear that trade routes out of Gracklstugh have become more dangerous lately, with fauna and primitive denizens of the Underdark all riled up about something. There are several secondhand tales of demons attacking isolated settlements.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Shade &amp; Yzak go to the West Cleft District, bypassing the duergar guards with their badges and entering derro territory. Immediately the fires of industry are replaced by squalor, the sturdy architecture by crudely-carved tunnels, and grim seriousness with unnerving muttering and screaming. Thanks to Shade's shadow arts of Pass Without Trace, the hateful derro do not notice the pair as they wander the warrens, but the heroes do not find Droki among the insanity. Withdrawing from the West Cleft to the western end of Laduguer's Furrow, they set up in an abandoned guardhouse, lying low and surveilling traffic in and out of the district.</p>
<p>Back in the Darklake District, Zimmerl &amp; Zap go up to the Blade Bazaar and spot Droki darting around the market. Breaking into a sprint, they chase him as he heads out of the Darklake District, but he easily evades them, hiding in the teeming population of the metropolis.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Yzak &amp; Shade spot the speedy derro as he approaches his home in the West Cleft, and they sally forth after him back into the warrens. Still shrouded in Shade's shadows, they chase Droki into a tunnel, bypassing an illusion of him that he tries to throw them off with. Dashing out of the tunnel into a crowd of derro tormenting one another, Yzak takes Droki out with two well-placed crossbow bolts, hefts the unconscious derro and carries him past unseeing derro back to the abandoned guardhouse. The heroes bind his hands and go through his satchel, sifting past various dead vermin to find an arcane notebook, a lump of an unknown soapy greenish-black metal, giants' toenail clippings, and other treasures, not to mention Droki's Boots of Speed. Droki comes to around the same time Shade flags down Zap, Zimmerl, and the rest of the party. Droki sees that his satchel has been violated and flies into an epic tantrum, screaming and gnashing his teeth. He tries to stand and headbutt Shade, but the monk holds him back with ease. He is obsessed with events happening on time, and says the party has delayed fate by delaying him.</p>
<p>When asked after somewhat calming down, Droki reveals that his paymasters are the Gray Ghosts, who Zap and Yzak know to be a thieves' guild composed of derro, duergar "calassabrak" outcasts, and the odd escaped slave. They are currently at war with the Keepers of the Flame, who executed their previous leader. Zap is intrigued, interested in the chaotic, revolutionary elements in the lawful city of slavers. Zimmerl wants to execute him and bring his satchel back to Overlake Hold, but soon the group decides to have him guide them to the Gray Ghosts' hideout (he declines simply telling them where it is, since they could just kill him and go). This interest increases when Zap asks if Droki knows another derro named Buppido: the courier says that Buppido has a lair of his own near the Gray Ghost hideout, but they do not often cross paths.</p>
</div><h2 class="adventure-log-post-title title" itemprop="name">
OOTA Session 15
</h2><div class="post-content" itemprop="text">
<p>In which the heroes meet with power players of Gracklstugh and leap into a web of loyalties. While delving into the Whorlstone Tunnels in search of the Gray Ghosts, the group encounters the missing Buppido (who has just murdered another original companion), and a strange myconid parade.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DAY</span> 18 – Alturiak 6 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">CHANCE</span> <span class="caps">MEETING</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SLAVE</span> <span class="caps">PITS</span><br>
Finally finishing slaving away in the Clan Xornbane ore refinery, Jagh is being ushered out by the duergar when he notices a familiar orcish face in the line of slaves being brought in: Ront of the Iceshield Tribe, who has been sold into bondage by the now-dead Many-Arrows orcs. Jagh offers 100 GP to the overseer for his former companion's freedom, but is told to ask someone higher in authority.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882117/Ront.PNG?1532162472"></p>
<p><span class="caps">GIANT</span> <span class="caps">RAMPAGE</span><br>
As Jagh is headed back toward the Gholbrorn's Lair (not knowing the party has been kicked out), the rest of the group has walked across the city from the abandoned guardhouse where they interrogated Droki, with the derro courier and all their other companions in tow. As all the heroes are in a large plaza in the Darklake District, a two-headed stone giant bursts through a gate into the district, knocking a duergar guard clear across the square and causing him to land with a sickening crunch. The giant is immensely strong, and nearly crushes Shade with a crushing fist, and bowls Yzak over with an anvil thrown across the plaza. Zap is able to incapacitate the two-headed giant with Tasha's Hideous Laughter, and as he rolls around on the ground, delivers a precise but potent blow to knock him unconscious, sensing the giant's fear.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882116/Stone_Giant1.PNG?1532162365"></p>
<p>Duergar soldiers, including "xarrorn" flame-lancers, arrive to secure the area just as a second (sane and one-headed) stone giant walks through the gate. The other giant cradles his fallen friend, saying that his name is Dorhun, apprentice priest to the leader of Clan Cairngorm (the local stone giants, loyal to the Deepking), Stonespeaker Hgraam. The fallen giant is Rihuud, a fellow apprentice, who had been "communing with the stone" in Cairngorm Cavern when he went mad, sprouted a second head, and stormed out. Dorhun says that the Stonespeaker will wish to show thanks to the heroes for stopping Rihuud's rampage nonlethally. A trio of Stoneguards who show up in the aftermath agree to escort the heroes to Cairngorm Cavern for this rare audience with outsiders. As they part ways, Zimmerl belatedly realizes that Dorhun's name was one of those on the bags of giant toenail clippings in Droki's bag, pointing to future use in some sort of ritual. Droki, who has just been prevented from running off by Sarith and Jimjar, insists that the toenails he carries are his own business.</p>
<p><span class="caps">REQUISITIONING</span> <span class="caps">EQUIPMENT</span><br>
Visiting Overlake Hold to requisition equipment from the Stoneguard armories, the heroes mostly obtain healing potions, but also gain the freedom of two slaves: Jagh requests Ront (to be obtained later), and Yzak purchases a svirfneblin tutor by the name of Maguff. Maguff is not from Blingdenstone, but is acquainted with a couple who were: Elroar and Pruanna Rowsdower, Zap's parents, who he says were sold about a tenday ago to drow of House Faen Tlabbar, the very house whose emissary Quavthrae Faen Tlabbar the party took a tip from last night in pre-empting the scout Xalith Masq'ilyr.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THEMBERCHAUD</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">KEEPERS</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FLAME</span><br>
While leaving Overlake Hold, the party finds the door blocked by a trio of duergar in black robes emblazoned with red flames. They are Keepers of the Flame, the psionic priests who serve Themberchaud the Wyrmsmith; the leader is named Gartokkar Xundorn. Unlike the Stoneguards following the party, they are not content to wait on the foreigners' travel itinerary, and lead the party across the city to Themberchaud's Cavern immediately.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882114/Themberchaud.jpg?1532162134"></p>
<p>Brought within the dragon's lair, the heroes are introduced to pampered, vain, and fat Father of Flame, the Everburning, the Foundry's Heart – Themberchaud, Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh. Themberchaud dismisses Gartokkar and the other Keepers in the room; the priest-mystics are annoyed at this exclusion, but have no choice but to nervously comply. Once he has a private audience with the heroes, the Wyrmsmith turns one by one to their backgrounds, finding especial interest in Shade's infatuation with him, and laughing when Jagh informs him of his espionage against slaver organizations. He is briefly interested in Yzak's denial of his kobold heritage, but when the ranger defies him he channels his draconic aura of fear, causing Yzak to cower in terror. Once they can confer normally, Themberchaud says that, having heard of the heroes' prowess in defeating a giant, he wishes their services as his agents in Gracklstugh, and will provide his protection in turn. His first mission, he explains, is simply for them to do whatever it is the Keepers ask him to do, but to report to him before reporting to the priests. Themberchaud is starting to believe that the Keepers are keeping things from him, and speaking in his name when he would rather they not. He wonders why he is content with a trickle of gold and slaves, and why he does not force the city to bend the knee to him. Finding new servants from outside the Keepers, he now wishes to gain intelligence for his next move. Unable to conceive that anyone would refuse him, the dragon sends the heroes away before they can mull a decision or respond, tossing them each a golden badge stamped in his likeness that he tells them to wear with pride.</p>
<p>Outside, Gartokkar darkly asks what business these foreigners had with the Wyrmsmith, not getting much from these close-lipped foreigners except for insults. Gartokkar explains that, as long as the heroes are here, he has need of their services: the Keepers have lost face recently when a red dragon egg of theirs was stolen by the Gray Ghosts, a thieves' guild of derro, outcasts, and slaves. Gartokkar wants the heroes to return the egg if possible, and also to confirm the thieves' involvement in the "great disturbance" in the Underdark sensed by the Keepers' great mystics. The heroes tell Gartokkar that Demogorgon has been summoned to the Material Plane, and that they saw him in Sloobludop. The priest believes them, but is fixated on the Ghosts, and dismisses any suggestion they are not behind it as delusions, ignorance, or outright lies. Zimmerl also outright accuses Gartokkar of planning to replace Themberchaud with the wyrmling to be hatched from the stolen egg, which the priest flatly denies. Gartokkar says that the Keepers have identified a Gray Ghost agent – a derro called Droki. The heroes agree to follow Droki to his employers in the West Cleft, chuckling to themselves since Droki is already among them (with Yzak wearing his signature hat). Zimmerl even asks Droki if he knows a derro named Droki; when he says 'no' Gartokkar laughs and says that goes to prove that not all derro know one another.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AUDIENCE</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">STONESPEAKER</span>&nbsp;<br>
On this side of the city already, the heroes traverse the Southfurrow District and descend down a long tunnel into Cairngorm Cavern, home of the stone giants, leaving their Stoneguard escort at the entrance – the giants value their privacy, and normally only Deepking Horgar is allowed to visit the cavern. Passing through their realm of darkness and silence, seeing the giants thoughtfully carving their masterpieces of stone, the heroes eventually reach the holiest spot in the cavern, where they meet Hgraam, stonespeaker of the stone giant god Skoraeus Stonebones and leader of the clan.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882115/Stone_Giant.PNG?1532162334"></p>
<p>The first thing Hgraam says to them is "I remember you." He says that centuries ago in his own past, he saw the heroes' future. He says they will go to a place called "Gravenhollow", and though a wiser man than he would be required to explain more, he now knows his role as ordained by the Stonebones. The stonespeaker gives a cryptic prophecy on the evil stirring in the Underdark so they might pay heed to the signs: "A cave with two faces. Rock devoured, and the land overgrown. The pebble believes itself flesh. The earth rejects its wards, and the tunnels shake in fury." Hgraam has his apprentice Dorhun grant them a crystal he has enchanted with divination powers; the heroes bow in thanks and take their leave.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GRISLY</span> <span class="caps">DISCOVERY</span><br>
As the others return to the abandoned guardhouse overlooking the West Cleft, Jagh goes back to the Darklake District, finding at Overlake Hold that Ront has been freed as agreed, and that he should be waiting at the Ghohlbrorn's Lair. At the inn, Murghol Muzgardt points Jagh to one of the private rooms. Here the druid is shocked to find Ront's limbs and organs arrayed in a macabre spiral, in the style of Buppido's serial murders. After forcing the innkeeper to look upon the scene, Jagh storms back to join the party.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DERRO</span> <span class="caps">RIOTERS</span><br>
As duergar guards open the gate for the party to enter the West Cleft District, a mob of derro spills out. The party makes short work of the five who break off and charge them, earning a silent nod of respect from the sergeant leading the hastily-assembled duergar phalanx that holds the line against the rioters. Sneaking past the duergar into the realm of filth and madness that is the derro slum, the party is subjected to Droki informing them that this is no mere riot but a Uniting War: that the derro tunnels delve deeper than the duergar know, and that their numbers are swollen. When their population grows too large, the derro savants declare a Uniting War, launching a reckless horde against whatever foe they may cross, fighting until their numbers have fallen to manageable levels, purged of the weak. Nonethless, Droki leads them as promised to the Whorlstone Tunnels, where he contacts his employers in the Gray Ghosts.<br>

<p><span class="caps">WHORLSTONE</span> <span class="caps">TUNNELS</span>: <span class="caps">ENTRY</span><br>
Finding a tunnel network with strange rock formations and the phosphorescent fungi indicative of faerzress (the magical "radiation" suffusing the Underdark), the heroes also note bigwigs and pygmyworts – magical mushrooms which can enlarge or reduce them, respectively. After the heroes sneak upon and slay a carrion crawler feasting on a two-headed grimlock, Droki runs forward, eats a pygmywort, and tries to escape through a crack in the wall, but Zap stops him with Tasha's Hideous Laughter and traps him in a manacle.<br>

<p><span class="caps">WHORLSTONE</span> <span class="caps">TUNNELS</span>: <span class="caps">BUPPIDO</span>'S <span class="caps">LAIR</span><br>
After mulling the crossing of a black pool for some time (considering throwing Droki in after he insists there is nothing living within the pool, and it is pleasantly warm), the party instead decides to head into a chamber emanating the nauseating stench of rotting meat. Here, Zap finds Buppido hunched over a two-headed goblin corpse, humming off-key. The entire cavern is filled with humanoid remains in all stages of decomposition – goblins, derro, svirfneblin, and grimlocks. The whole group sneaking forward hidden by Shade's shadow arts, Jagh opens with a Dispel Magic on Buppido, only to discover that he is not truly there. Hearing the derro's voice echo through the chamber announcing that his "shrine" is nearly finished and that his "faithful" are finally honoring him. Six two-skulled skeletons arise from the dark power at hand, shambling mismatched abominations cobbled together from the assorted gore present. Deciding the party is ready to receive truth in their hearts, Buppido reveals himself with a Burning Hands spell, and is shocked when they are able to defeat his faithful skeletons as well as his own "divine" form. Immediately as he dies at Shade's hands, Buppido's ghost rises from his corpse to complete the unfinished business of forming a "great path" for the derro people to follow, but his undead form merely prolongs the inevitable, and soon enough Buppido's ghost is beaten, his screams heard by no one (silenced by Yzak's spells).</p>
<p><span class="caps">PELEK</span>'S <span class="caps">GHOST</span><br>
After vanquishing Buppido (a derro madder than most), a second ghost rises from the humanoid remains scattered throughout the room – it is the spirit of a deep gnome from Blingdenstone named Pelek, who says he was killed recently by Buppido and chopped to pieces. He asks the party to bring his body parts, or at least one of them, to his home village for a proper burial so he might go on to the afterlife with the gnomish pantheon. His hand, he explains, should be easily identifiable since it bears an obsidian ring, but he thinks he saw it animated by the foul necromancy of Buppido's shrine and skitter away through a crack in the wall. Zap and Jagh scour the room and find only other minor treasures; the druid goes on to pile the gore in the center of the chamber and cast Flaming Sphere to form a makeshift funeral pyre, and the party makes camp in the small chamber where Droki tries (again) to escape captivity.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DAY</span> 19 – Alturiak 7&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">PARADE</span> OF <span class="caps">FOOLS</span><br>
Waking in the morning, the party is pleasantly surprised to find Gracklstugh's pollution does not reach to the tunnels, and they have no issue with grackle-lung. Also, Sarith Kzekarit announces that his headaches have completely ceased!<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882122/Sarith.PNG?1532163039"></p>
<p>Bypassing the diseased pool and delving further past Buppido's lair, the party quickly comes upon a strange sight: three myconid adults and five sprouts, all but one of the sprouts frantically dancing to a silent tune. Two quaggoths covered with mushroom growths and yellow mold are hunched nearby. Stool recognizes the non-dancing sprout as his buddy Rumpadump. Hidden as they are by Shade's shadow arts, Zimmerl contacts Rumpadump telepathically and asks him what's going on. The leader of the myconids, an adult named Voosbur, senses someone trying to communicate with one of his "troupe". He launches his own rapport spores, which feel odd and strangely intoxicating compared to Stool's. Voosbur happily tells the party how he was attracted by the bigwigs and pygmyworts growing here, and how he arrived here not by wandering the tunnels of the Underdark but by "traveling the Lady's dream."<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/882123/Rumpadump.PNG?1532163117"></p>
<p>Voosbur describes "the Lady" as a powerful being who loves and guides all myconids and offers to share "the Lady's gift" with the party, allowing them to travel through her dreams as well. Stool says that he has no idea what Voosbur is talking about, and Rumpadump subtly tells Zimmerl via telepathy that the other myconids aren't behaving right. Sarith announces that his head is aching again as he stumbles toward the myconids, trying to warn the heroes away from them but unable to shake off the influence of whatever is affecting him. Voosbur takes no offense that the heroes refuse his offer to teach them how to travel the Lady's dream, simply bidding them farewell as the myconids resume their dancing. Rumpadump begs the heroes let him join their party, saying they need to get to Neverlight Grove to make sure these "strange spores" haven't corrupted his home yet. Meanwhile Sarith joins the myconids, turning to give the heroes a look of terror and despair before his face loses all expression. Voosbur's dancing myconids enter a mushroom patch and use a Tree Stride-like ability to vanish from sight, traveling elsewhere "via the Lady's dream." Before Sarith can follow them, the heroes try every means to keep him from leaving: he resists Zap's Hideous Laughter spell, as well as Jagh's Entangle, but Shade is able to dash forward and tackle the afflicted drow. For now, at least, Sarith remains with the party, but his mind seems to have been subsumed by "the Lady", whomever she may be.</p>

Day 19 – Alturiak 7 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">FUNGI</span> <span class="caps">THICKET</span>&nbsp;<br>
Continuing past the cavern where they encountered the dancing myconid parade and met their new companion Rumpadump, the heroes find a passage filled with a thick fungus thicket. As they try to harvest the many exotic fungi here, swarms of centipedes and spiders attack from all sides. Zap and Shade eat pygmyworts to shrink down so the fungi don't provide cover to the stinging insects. After beating back the bugs, Stool and Rumpadump help the party catalog the fungal treasures, from basic food and phosphorescents&nbsp;to exotic types like incendiaries,&nbsp;Nilhogg's Noses (which enhance the sense of smell) and madness-inducing "devil's mushrooms."</p>
<p><span class="caps">WANDERING</span> <span class="caps">XORN</span>&nbsp;<br>
Doubling back around toward the diseased pool, Zap is scouting ahead when a xorn – a three-armed, three-legged earth elemental with a mouth atop its body and an eye between each arm – glides out of the rock of the tunnel wall. Zap is startled, but as a svirfneblin knows xorn to be not aggressive predators, but the beggars and thieves of the Underdark, always seeking precious metals and stones to eat. The group's only Primordial speakers (Topsy &amp; Turvy) fled the previous day to avoid arrest, so Zap resorts to gestures, offering one of the gems cursed by Lolth stolen from during their escape from Velkynvelve. Zimmerl establishes a telepathic bond, asking the xorn directions around the Whorlstone Tunnels in exchange for guiding it to the Clan Xornbane ore refinery.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DISEASED</span> <span class="caps">POOL</span><br>
While nearby, the party decides to have Prince Derendil dip Droki into the black pool near the entry tunnel to test out its effects. The derro laughs madly as he is withdrawn after a thorough dunking, having caught "cackle fever." Luckily Derendil – and Sarith, who remains suspended around the quaggoth/elf's neck, mutely dancing to the Lady's tune – resist the contagion, but are quarantined in the rear of the party. Yzak suggests Zap &amp; Jimjar collect some diseased water into a barrel-like fungus for later use (gnomes are strangely immune to cackle fever.)</p>
<p><span class="caps">TRUST</span> A <span class="caps">FLUMPH</span>!&nbsp;<br>
Deciding not to head toward the Gray Ghosts' hideout just yet, the party heads east and encounters what appears to be a floating jellyfish with two tall eyestalks, glowing a faint green. Known as a flumph for the sound they make when jetting through the air, these lawful good creatures subsist by draining energy from psionic Underdark settlements (such as those of duergar). Flumphs often are given descriptive names by non-flumphs, so Zimmerl christens him "Jigglycloud." Deciding the party are interesting and not overtly evil, the flumph draws a map of the part of the Tunnels it has scouted, and offers to accompany them indefinitely through the Underdark.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883781/Flumph.PNG?1532675629"></p>
<p><span class="caps">TWO</span>-<span class="caps">HEADED</span> <span class="caps">GRIMLOCKS</span><br>
Pressing on, the party sneaks up on a band of foraging grimlocks – degenerate once-human creatures rendered blind after eons of living in the Underdark, and debased cannibal cultists after being twisted by service to mind flayers. These particular grimlocks seem to have sprouted a second, screaming head. The party ambushes them and puts them to the sword.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883782/Grimlock.PNG?1532675657"></p>
<p><span class="caps">RAUCOUS</span> <span class="caps">MESA</span><br>
Finding a spiraling mesa in a large cavern, Shade and Jagh climb to the top and discover the faerzress which sculpted the chamber has created a magical "echo chamber," allowing them to hear the sounds of Gracklstugh above – the rhythmic clank and roar of forges, the mad screaming of derro, the low rumble of Themberchaud's displeasure, and even snatches of conversation. Focusing in on some of the sounds to glean information, the two hear the voice of Gorglak, the Stoneguard whom Zap forced into ritual suicide, suggesting that the recent past is contained here as well.</p>
<p>Jagh is able to pierce the storm of noise to hear Gartokkar, the Keeper of the Flame who hired them to find the Gray Ghosts, speaking disloyally of his master Themberchaud, suggesting the Wyrmsmith is growing stronger and more resistant to the clerics' coaxing, appeasement, and psionic manipulation. Shade, however, is stricken with madness when he attempts to glean knowledge from the din. Believing that Jagh is trying to kill him, Shade stabs the druid with his spear before being quickly subdued: Zap rides Araigne up the mesa and hits him with Tasha's Hideous Laughter as the monstrous spider webs up the mad monk. Zap himself is stricken by a wild magic surge as he casts his spell, and is briefly transported to the Astral Plane. Knowing that flumphs can draw out mental energies, Zimmerl aids "Jigglycloud" in some impromptu "psychic chirurgery," ending Shade's spell of madness.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FOUNTAIN</span> OF <span class="caps">EVIL</span><br>
Scouting to the north, Zap finds a narrow tunnel which he follows after consuming a pygmywort, and though he doesn't exit by himself at its end, he does find water trickling from the stalactites from the Darklake above – foul, black liquid that is poison to most.</p>
<p>Turning back south, the group finds a chamber with a black pool at its center, fed by water dripping from the ceiling. At the pool's center is a churning whirlpool, which some in the group at first take for a vortex leading to the Elemental Plane of Water – or perhaps a portal to the Abyss. As the group passes by, the captive Droki squeals with glee as the corrupt water elemental at the pool's center rises and roars toward the party, slamming into them as a dark wave. The water weird raises the pool's level, flooding most of the chamber before its evil essence is destroyed. Yzak uses some Dust of Dryness to absorb some of the corrupted water here.</p>
<p><span class="caps">QUAGGOTH</span> <span class="caps">SPORE</span> <span class="caps">SERVANTS</span><br>
Battered from their couple of hours of exploring, the party heads back toward the chamber near the entrance where they camped after defeating Buppido. While passing near the fungus thicket, the party finds a band of quaggoths much like those encountered with Voosbur's dancing myconid troupe – they are covered in mushroom growths and pale yellow mold. These quaggoths bound right past the hidden scout Zap, and are quickly put down by the party as the rogue attacks from behind. Stool and Rumpadump confirm these seem to be spore servants – which myconids often create by animating corpses with special spores – but these seem to be darker, tainted versions. No doubt they appeared by "traveling the Lady's dream" to the thicket as Voosbur described. Zap uses the Stonespeaker Crystal gifted to them by Hgraam to cast Speak With Dead on one of the dead quaggoths, but faerzress strikes twice: his divination is prevented, and a wild magic surge renders him invisible and inaudible for the next minute. His companions think he has been whisked to the Astral Plane again.</p>

While resting in their quaint cavern campsite, Zimmerl is on watch when a psychic gray ooze attacks the party, having squeezed through the crack in the wall that Droki had tried to escape through previously. The ooze screams telepathically "Flesh for the Faceless Lord!", an invocation of Juiblex, demon lord of oozes, that the party has heard before. Before they slay it, the ooze's mental attack proves that psychic damage within areas of faerzress carry the risk of madness, as Zimmerl succumbs to belief that everyone is trying to steal his valuables.</p>
<p>Arising from their rest, the party is racked by a vicious coughs as they hack up yellow mold much like that on the spore servants' fur. Passing the fungus thicket on their way back to exploring the Tunnels' east, the party sees another point of interest which has traveled through the Lady's dream – a patch of yellow mold is growing on a humanoid skeleton. Yzak harvests some of the mold to weaponize it later, and Zap finds a bag of magical sling stones hanging from the skeleton's belt.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DIRE</span> <span class="caps">DEN</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SPIDER</span> <span class="caps">KING</span><br>
Shade decides to eat a pygmywort and explore a set of narrow tunnels in the east, quickly finding them to be densely covered in spiderwebs. He finds that the tunnels lead west to some sort of fungus garden, but rather than explore this alone he goes deeper into the spider den. In the backmost chamber, he is ambushed by a horrific giant spider warped by demonic influence into a vaguely humanoid, two-headed abomination – the Spider King. Using his feline agility, the shadowdancer is able to quickly flee the spider's lair after being bitten, though the Spider King does not follow its prey out of its lair. The heroes all eat pygmyworts and brave the King's tunnels, battling it and its two attendant giant spiders to the death. Having conquered the Spider King's den, the heroes eye the fungus garden to the west.</p>

<p>Day 19 – Alturiak 7 (cont.)<br>
<span class="caps">GRAY</span> <span class="caps">GHOST</span> <span class="caps">GARDEN</span><br>
Zap, still in shrunken form from eating a pygmywort mushroom, sneaks out of the Spider King's lair into a fungal garden thick with the stench of rot. Zap is riding Araigne, and is soon followed by Yzak, Shade, and Jagh (in spider form.) Noting several exotic fungi, they also see a copper tube with a nozzle looming out over the pit they are in. While Yzak is pointing this out to Zap, a duergar with the facial tattoos of a "calassabrak" (outcast) appears behind the hose, spraying them with manure as two of his fellows use their racial Enlarge ability behind him. Shade (about 2 feet tall after eating the pygmywort) runs up the pit wall and beats one 10-foot duergar to death as Zap, Yzak, and Araigne slay the other two. Called to aid by these Gray Ghost gardeners, an alchemist named Lorthio Bukbukken appears, hurling a flask of alchemist fire onto Shade before being webbed by Spider-Jagh and finished off by Zap.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GRAY</span> <span class="caps">ALCHEMIST</span><br>
Looting the garden for exotic and edible fungi, the party moves on into the alchemy lab, which they ransack for gear after Jagh and Araigne wrestle over the burning pancakes on Lorthio's stove. Zap uses the Stonespeaker Crystal to speak with Lorthio's corpse, learning that this is the only Gray Ghost outpost in the Whorlstone Tunnels, and that though they had been ordered not to explore further into the caves, sometimes guild leaders would go deeper in on their own business. Lorthio's desk also has a mithral Laduguer holy symbol (Yzak knocks Droki out when the derro frantically claims it is his), and some alchemical formulas scrawled on torn scraps of parchment, which Zimmerl fails to decipher. In a secret compartment found by Jimjar is a letter written on a scrap of lizard hide, proclaiming that Werz Saltbaron will be "dealt with", and that Lorthio owes the author an elvish sword: Zimmerl's psionic investigation determines the previous owner of the letter was Gorglak, the corrupt Stoneguard who sought exotic weapons as bribes before his forced ritual suicide. Thus the party presumes that it was Gorglak who hired the Empty-Scabbard Killers to assassinate Werz, and they now have tangible evidence of corruption in the Stoneguard.</p>
<p>Finally, an Araigne-mounted Zap scouts up a 60-foot ladder, finding a narrow, winding tunnel which leads to the isolated easternmost pier of the Darklake Docks, the same spot the heroes were led by Buppido and Hemeth to make their secret landing in Gracklstugh. No doubt Buppido used this tunnel to effect his escape during Werz Saltbaron's assassination.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HUNGRY</span> <span class="caps">XORN</span><br>
Leaving the Gray Ghost hideout, Zap is still mounted on Araigne as he is scouting a tunnel, and is surprised by a xorn, perhaps the same one he saw that morning. Rather than offer it gems this time, he casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter, causing the elemental to guffaw as he sneaks away.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CULTIST</span> <span class="caps">PENS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Going north, the group comes upon a pair of derro standing around a cauldron, each carrying on a conversation while ignoring the other. One is talking of "the master", while the other is monologuing about a ring he once fished out of the Darklake. According to the flumph "Jigglycloud"'s reports, this is not Gray Ghost territory, but must be some other faction. Whoever they are, these two muttering derro are standing watch not just over their mushroom stew, but over a trio of captive cave bears.</p>
<p>After much debate over how they might poison the stewpot or release the bears upon the derro, the party simply sneaks forward and shoots the derro with their crossbows, one of them falling headfirst into the cauldron. One of the cave bears breaks free and is about to attack the party, but Jagh is able to calm the bears with his druidic knack for animal handling.</p>
<p><span class="caps">QUASIT</span> <span class="caps">PLAYGROUND</span> &amp; <span class="caps">CULTIST</span> <span class="caps">HIDEOUT</span><br>
Finding a crack in the wall near the derro tent, Zap downs a pygmywort and follows the path. Hearing cackling, he soon finds two pairs of quasit demons (often used as familiars or messengers by spellcasters or more powerful demons, just as are the devilish imps) wrestling one another in the narrow tunnels. Casting Disguise Self to resemble a quasit, the arcane trickster starts cackling as well and bluffs his way past the goldbricking demons.</p>
<p>He soon finds their masters. In a large chamber, Zap (still disguised as a quasit) finds a circle of derro savants performing a demonic ritual around a vaguely humanoid statue. A second head sprouts from the statue's neck, growing with each unholy verse – which includes the word "Demogorgon."<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883783/Quasit.PNG?1532675899"></p>
<p>The ritual over, Zap retreats back into the quasit playground as one of the cultists approaches, giving him an errand in Abyssal. Returning to the party waiting by the bear pens, Zap surprises them before dropping his illusory demon disguise. Coordinating a stealth assault using Shade's shadow arts for their approach, the party quickly eliminates the four quasits before they can flee to their derro masters. All in pygmywort-shrunken form, the heroes skulk into the cult hideout, ready to strike these degenerate derro in their very lair.</p>

<span class="caps">LAUNCHING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ASSAULT</span><br>
Lying in the shadows deepened by Shade's qi magic, the heroes plan their assault, the physical attackers popping faerzress-infused bigwig mushrooms to return to normal size. As Shade and Araigne dash up the embankment to attack the cultists, they see that the cult leader Narrak has a secret weapon – an ettin named Grula-Munga lumbers to his feet, having been asleep and out of view in a fungus-filled alcove. The two-headed giant lumbers to join the melee. Meanwhile Zap takes advantage of the chaos to sneak behind a pile of zurkhwood lumber, using Mage Hand to jam the lock on a kennel door where a two-headed death dog is kept.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">BUPPIDO</span> <span class="caps">RETURNS</span><br>
As the heroes engage the cult, the ghost of Buppido phases through the cavern wall, intent on his unfinished business of raising the derro to greatness. This time he uses his possession ability to seize control of Jagh's body, who is currently in the form of a bear. With the druid not only removed from the fight but turned against them, prospects look grim.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MELEE</span> ON <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PLATFORM</span><br>
The warlock Narrak is quickly slain by Shade and Araigne despite the shadows themselves jumping to shroud him in defense, his bodyguard Grula-Munga kept in hand by Zap's use of Hideous Laughter. Narrak's quasit familiar reveals himself from invisibility, but fails to frighten or wound anyone before he is sent back to the Abyss. The derro savants of Narrak's cult are wily sorcerers who prove tougher than the heroes expect, blasting them with Lightning Bolts and Burning Hands as one of them Blinks in and out of the Ethereal Plane. Araigne falls to their sorcery, but not before paralyzing one of the savants.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">BRAINS</span> <span class="caps">OVER</span> <span class="caps">BRAWN</span>&nbsp;<br>
As Grula-Munga lays about with his huge morningstar and battleaxe, nearly killing Shade, Zap, and Yzak, the possessed Bear-Jagh approaches ominously, attacking Yzak as well even as the death dog and its kennel-keeper finally join the fray. Zimmerl is able to psionically trick Grula-Munga into thinking that Yzak is in fact Narrak in disguise, and the kobold commands the ettin to slay the bear. After a devastating pair of blows to the possessed druid, Buppido is forced out of his body as Jagh returns to half-orc form. As the insane derro ghost seeks to make his getaway by sinking into the floor and promising future reprisal, his manifestation is destroyed by Jagh, Yzak, and Zap pounding on his head.<br>

<p><span class="caps">MOPPING</span> UP<br>
Grula-Munga is tricked into killing the death dog, and the remaining savants and their kennelmaster are slain, leaving only the ettin. Yzak tries to trick Munga into thinking that Grula, the other head, has offended "Narrak", but the ettin sees through this brazen bluff. Shade and Zap are able to slay the two-headed giant before it can kill any of them.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LOOTING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WARLOCK</span>'S <span class="caps">TREASURES</span><br>
Despite the protests of a shrieker fungus, the heroes explore the chamber and find the mad scribblings of Narrak, which Yzak intends to decipher, as well as a jar of Keoghtom's Ointment and a letter from Droki to Narrak telling of how Droki has been sneaking into Cairngorm Cavern to spy on the stone giants. The object of the cult's ritual, a statue with the apprentice stonespeaker Dorhun's name inscribed on it, still has a second head actively growing from its neck – which Zap suggests bringing to Stonespeaker Hgraam so he can break the curse.</p>

<span class="caps">PROFANE</span> <span class="caps">KNOWLEDGE</span><br>
After pushing the derro savant paralyzed by the late Araigne to his demise in a pit trap full of green slime, Yzak collects the heroes' followers from the cave bear den. Prince Derendil informs him proudly that they have just fought off a band of grimlocks. As the others lie down their bedrolls in the Demogorgon cult's ritual room after a long day of exploring that began with encountering the myconid parade which triggered Sarith's current catatonia, Zimmerl takes advantage of his elvish&nbsp;sleeplessness and pores over the derro cult leader Narrak's mad scribblings. In his perusal, he learns two rituals of the cult: how to cause a one-headed creature to sprout a second head (as the cult has done to numerous test subjects in the Tunnels, and at least one stone giant in Gracklstugh above), and also how to graft a severed head onto a living creature. With time left before his fellows awake and no monsters molesting their rest, Zimmerl pieces together the alchemical formulas of the duergar Gray Ghost Lorthio Bukbukken, learning how to craft acid and alchemist's fire. In the meantime Yzak takes the time to summon another animal companion to replace the fallen Araigne – Vesper, a giant bat.</p>

<span class="caps">PACK</span> OF <span class="caps">LESSER</span> <span class="caps">TANAR</span>'RI&nbsp;<br>
Acting on their own exploration and the flumph "Jigglycloud"'s intelligence, the party heads east when they awake in what a surface dweller would call early morning. As they traverse the Tunnels, they run afoul of a pack of dretches – the most miserable, self-loathing, and stupid of all demons, no doubt summoned by the Demogorgon-worshiping cult. And yet the dretches make up for their weakness with sheer malice. Rushing toward Zimmerl and the javelin-hurling Jagh, the dretches are ambushed by the hidden Shade, Zap, Yzak, and Vesper. Yzak in particular, who has just made a breakthrough in his hunting skills against fiends, fires his crossbows with aplomb. Only two of the six make it to the spellcasters, but they are joined by a quasit, transforming out of bat shape to attack Zimmerl. These lesser and least tanar'ri are quickly sent back to the Abyss from which they spawned.<br>

<p><span class="caps">DUMPING</span> <span class="caps">PIT</span> <span class="caps">BATTLE</span>&nbsp;<br>
After Zap shrinks himself with a pygmywort and uses Mage Hand to fly about in his own cook-pot to scout a narrow tunnel, he finds a cavern reeking of rotting flesh. Armed with his report, the party decides to walk around to the normal-sized entrance, the physical attackers gobbling bigwig mushrooms and Jagh shifting to giant constrictor snake form. The cavern consists of a giant pit filled with corpses and body parts, watched over by a derro crossbowman as latent necromantic energies have possessed seven duergar and grimlock zombies on the bottom of the pit. The bigwig-enhanced Jagh dominates the field as a gargantuan serpent, and Zimmerl mentally forces the derro to leap headfirst down into the corpse pit. Thinking victory is proclaimed as the last zombie falls, Zap is grabbed on the ankle by a disembodied, shriveled hand with stubby fingers and an obsidian ring – the hand of Pelek, a deep gnome victim of Buppido's whose ghost the party met in the derro killer's lair. After pinning it to the floor with a well-placed crossbow bolt, Zimmerl studies the ring and determines that faerzress has turned it into a one-use magic item capable of turning its wearer's skin into obsidian for a short time.<br>

<p>Finding themselves amidst a heap of duergar, derro, grimlock, and goblin body parts, the heroes consider whether the Demogorgon cult's head-grafting ritual might be used for good. Perhaps their catatonic drow companion Sarith Kzekarit, suffering from migraines and infested with strange spores, might benefit from a second head?</p>

<p>In which the heroes bring news of the Demogorgon cult and the missing dragon egg out of the Whorlstone Tunnels, bringing chaos to Gracklstugh.<br>
<br>
Day 20 – Alturiak 8 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EGG</span> &amp; <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">OBELISK</span>&nbsp;<br>
Deciding to assault the remaining chamber of the Whorlstone Tunnels headlong, the party follows Prince Derendil as he charges down the passage and rams into the fungus-covered door. The quaggoth failing to break it down, Yzak discreetly mentions that Derendil might instead comfort Amra in the rear, as Wandering Shade tries finesse. The shadowdancer teleports through the shadows to the other side, raising the bar so the others can come through. Beyond is a cavern filled with bright light, and a two-peaked rock formation featuring a black obelisk of alien metal, and the large red dragon egg stolen by the Gray Ghosts from the Keepers of the Flame, who plotted to use the hatchling within to replace Themberchaud as Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh. At the obelisk's base is Pliinki, a derro savant who breaks off her study of the structure to defend the cavern against the invading heroes.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883804/Spectator.PNG?1532677569"></p>
<p>Yzak flies upon Vesper into the middle of the chamber, shooting Pliinki and knocking her out with drow poison as Vesper bites one of the derro flunkies. A spectator – a summoned beholderkin bound to defend the obelisk – flies down from above the doorway, telepathically projecting its glee at having intruders to kill. It blasts the beastmaster with a confusion ray, causing him to attack his own mount, but luckily the ranger misses in the commotion. Shade clambers up the cliffside, clawing the spectator in revenge for a hit from a wounding ray, and blocking the bridge toward the obelisk to prevent Pliinki's henchmen from reviving her. Set up to succeed, Zimmerl finishes off the spectator with a mental blast.</p>
<p>As the heroes' followers enter the room, Droki screams that the obelisk must be repaired. The heroes trained in arcana (Zap, Zimmerl, Yzak) can sense that the chipped structure is leaking a quasi-magical eldritch energy. Putting the lump of metal from Droki's satchel against it, it is instantly absorbed by the pillar. Tying up Pliinki, Zap goes on to slash her throat and interrogate the body with the Stonespeaker Crystal. He learns that Pliinki and Narrak's cult believed that the derro god Diirinka had placed the obelisk here, and they intended to use it to conquer Gracklstugh. Currently the obelisk seems to be tied to teleportation magic, and has been bringing surface items down to the Tunnels, including a shilmaerl – an ancient elven coin. Zimmerl mystically senses that the obelisk is tied to thousands of alternate Material Planes as well – as he touches its unknown metal, he swaps places with another Zimmerl from a parallel world who has a different psionic talent. Zap and Yzak trade places with alternates who have slightly different spell selections; the new Yzak has black scales instead of white. The chaotic neutral Shade is replaced by a chaotic good Shade with a "snow leopard" fur pattern, leaving Jagh Gnowske as the only true "original" party member. None of the heroes decide to activate the obelisk's teleportation powers themselves.</p>
<p>The other object of interest in the chamber is the 4-ft tall dragon egg sought by both Themberchaud and his treacherous Keepers of the Flame. Rolling the 180-lb egg back to the Gray Ghosts' hideout, the heroes intend to hatch it rather than return it to either the Keepers or Themberchaud. Jagh makes a quick trip to the faerzress-infused mesa, risking madness to commune with the storm of sound, where he hears that Themberchaud commanded the Keepers to inform him of any other red dragons in the Underdark so that he might let them know their place. After having Glabagool scour Lorthio Bukbukken's alchemy lab of any vermin the newborn dragon might see and imprint upon, they determine that Droki has outlived his usefulness, and Zap murders the derro courier. The heroes leave the room except for Zimmerl, who heats the egg until the wyrmling within begins to bite its way through the shell. Helping it hatch, Zimmerl is the first creature seen by the eyes of this dragon as they blink open. The creature, covered in shiny scarlet scales, embraces the drow as its parent. Its first meal is the fresh corpse of Droki, lying upon the ground.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">REPORTING</span> TO <span class="caps">CAPTAIN</span> <span class="caps">BLACKSKULL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Returning to Gracklstugh proper via the Gray Ghosts' hidden tunnel to the Darklake Docks, the party finds that the "Uniting War" of the derro has swept through the city, with battle damage being repaired by tireless workers all over the city. The duergar give the heroes nods of grudging respect, acknowledging their role in helping to stem the initial riot that began the failed revolt. Using this newfound social capital, the group heads for Overlake Hold, the stalagmite temple-fortress headquarters of the Stoneguard. Their first order of business is speaking to Grim Herald Morndin Gloomstorm, the priest of Laduguer who has been translating the book written in Sylvan by the hag Nanny Plunk. He seems shaken by having read it – it is a transcript of every conversation had in the course of a year, three years ago, in the village of Sloobludop. How could anyone have such a thing? Morndin also accepts payment to bring Laduguer's blessing to cure the latent madness lingering in the minds of the heroes thanks to the horrors they have witnessed since their escape from Velkynvelve.</p>
<p>In the office of Errde Blackskull, the party reveals Gorglak's letter to Lorthio Bukbukken, showing evidence of corruption within the Stoneguard. More worrying still is the notebook of Narrak and its revelation of Demogorgon's influence on the derro, backed up by a Speak With Dead spell cast on Droki's head. Errde believes that her worst fears are confirmed, and that she must immediately begin an inquisition to find which of the clan lairds have been corrupted and influenced by the derro. She does not enlist the heroes in this effort, but keeps her word to offer them safe passage to the Deepkingdom's frontiers, and promises her aid in any legal entanglements they may have.</p>
<p>On their way out of the hold, the party is again approached by a cloaked guard claiming to be an incognito&nbsp;Horgar V, who insists that Themberchaud is possessed by a demon lord and must be slain. Yzak is able to convince the supposed Deepking&nbsp;that the Wyrmsmith is no longer a problem.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TAKING</span> <span class="caps">CARE</span> OF <span class="caps">BUSINESS</span><br>
The nearby Blade Bazaar, also in the Darklake District, is the next stop. There the merchant madness continues: a street sweeper follows the party, loudly accusing them of being spies for the drow until a soldier backhands him, telling him these are honored foreign heroes. The armorsmith who has forged a chain shirt for Prince Derendil demands quick payment, saying he would die if not paid within the next minute. The only sane merchant seems to be Ylsa Henstak. Meeting in her well-guarded office, Zap shows her the shilmaerl and Pliinki's ledger of items teleported to the Tunnels by the obelisk. Ylsa keeps her word, allowing the party to hire on as guards for any Merchant Council caravan leaving Gracklstugh. After Ylsa refutes Zimmerl's suggestion they might trade with Gauntlgrym or Blingdenstone, the group signs on, at Yzak's suggestion, with a caravan bound for the hidden trading post of Mantol-Derith leaving in four days.</p>
<p>Next up is Cairngorm Cavern, where the group gives Stonespeaker Hgraam the statue head being used by the cult for a ritual against his apprentice Dorhun so the stonespeaker can cure him. Hgraam thanks the "little dreams" for their aid, and promises to have Dorhun and Rihuud investigate the mysterious obelisk.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DUERGAR</span> <span class="caps">POWER</span> <span class="caps">PLAY</span>&nbsp;<br>
Deciding to swing by the nearby gate to the West Cleft District to see if all of the derro were exterminated after their failed revolt, the group finds a mixed force of duergar some 100 strong guarding the entrance – an infantry company supported by xarrorn fire-lancers and kavalrachni tarantula-riders. The officer in command will not let them open the gates without a truly pressing reason, but Yzak is satisfied by his answer that many hundreds, if not thousands of derro remain infesting the warrens within.</p>
<p>As the party prepares to move on, they are approached by six Stoneguard knights (not part of the guard company.) The senior knight addresses them harshly in Undercommon, stating they are under arrest for consorting with the renegade captain Errde Blackskull. The guard company commander, who was just praising the heroes for those very actions, looks tense. The accusing knight tosses a parchment to the guard officer, saying it is a royal writ justifying his actions. As it lands in the officer's hand, Zap casts Minor Illusion, making it read "The bearer of this letter is insane; trust nothing he says." The officer accuses the knight of lying (a crime in Gracklstugh) and tears the writ in half, to which the baffled Stoneguard knight says "Those were the Deepking's words!", and all duergar present draw their weapons. The six knights are quickly overwhelmed by the guard company, a cavalry charge following a devastating crossbow volley. Meanwhile the heroes make themselves scarce, Zap grabbing the torn royal writ on the way out. Zimmerl's psychometry determines that the declaration actually was signed by the Deepking, in the company of his very attractive consort&nbsp;in his throne room.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EXECUTION</span> OF <span class="caps">ERRDE</span> <span class="caps">BLACKSKULL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Heading back toward the hidden entrance to the Whorlstone Tunnels, the party notices a huge crowd gathered in the same plaza where they fought Rihuud during the giant's cult-induced rampage. A throng of duergar and travelers are kept at bay by a square of soldiers. In the clearing in the center kneels a battered Errde Blackskull at the feet of a headsman, standing next to a Laduguer priestess who is addressing the crowd. The priestess says that Deepking Horgar has declared Captain Blackskull a traitor for consorting with dangerous foreigners and sending them into the derro district, inciting the bloody rebellion which has just been quashed. The heroes believe that the Council of Lairds must have quickly convinced Horgar to act against Errde after she began accusing them of conspiring with the derro. They try to interfere to save their best ally in Gracklstugh, but the headsman is too quick, bringing down his heavy greataxe to cleave off Captain Blackskull's head. Zimmerl is, however, able to psionically trick the priestess into believing Errde is innocent, and she flees toward Overlake Hold, turning invisible as she barrels through the crowd. Before melting away with the rest of the crowd, the heroes obtain&nbsp;Errde's head,&nbsp;thanks to Zap's&nbsp;surreptitious use of Mage Hand, planning&nbsp;for later interrogation via Speak With Dead.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PLOTTING</span> AT <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HIDEOUT</span><br>
Bringing the news of developments in the city to their followers in the Gray Ghost safehouse, the party decides not to wait for their magic item contracts to be fulfilled -&nbsp;it is time to leave the City of Blades, the last four days having been far too eventful. But first, Themberchaud must be informed of the egg and the Keepers' treachery. The group agrees that entering the Wyrmsmith's presence is too dangerous, especially with the defiant Yzak in the party, so decide to have Zimmerl telepathically compel a proxy to do it for them: namely, Gartokkar Xundorn, their contact in the Keepers. Preparations are made for their getaway, including Zap using the stolen Deepking's seal to forge a letter of marque allowing them to commandeer whatever Darklake vessels they may require.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RAGE</span> OF <span class="caps">DRAGONS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Lying low across from the Keepers' guardhouse at the mouth of Themberchaud's cavern after sneaking across the city, the heroes spot Gartokkar coming out. Zimmerl succeeds, causing the priest to believe that the best course of action is to approach the Wyrmsmith in contrition, confessing everything and begging his forgiveness. Gathering the Keepers' stoutest fighters and wisest priests, Gartokkar leads them into the dragon's lair. Minutes after their departure, there is a thundering roar of rage, followed by the sound of a jet of flame as Themberchaud incinerates the entire delegation. Themberchaud flies furiously out of his cavern, releasing a gout of flame toward the Hold of the Deepking as he crosses the city, landing on Overlake Hold. Punching a hole in the side of the stalagmite fortress, he then breathes deeply into the side, roasting many duergar within. The dragon bellows loudly in Undercommon, his words clearly heard throughout the city's cavern, over the screams of duergar and slaves alike. Themberchaud demands the unswerving loyalty of all in the city as he takes rightful place as their lord, and demands the Deepking reveal himself on his battlements.<br>
<br>

As the dragon claims his domain, Yzak mounts Vesper and flies in to thieve from Themberchaud's hoard. Landing for only a moment on the mountain of coins and stealing a few quick handfuls, Yzak is surprised to hear his name being called. An ancient kobold wearing the Keepers' robes hails him from an alcove: it is Yzak's great-great-great-grandfather, a priest of Kurtulmak named Galax'Arix'Taklak'Hagnar'Irtos'Sniv'Kashak'Meepo (his birth name was Galax, but he added syllables to his name after every important event in his life.) Galax has important information to reveal to his descendant, but Yzak is in a great hurry to escape before Themberchaud returns, so he has Vesper grab Galax in his claws as he flies away.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">SECOND</span> <span class="caps">SORTIE</span><br>
After a daring dash across Gracklstugh as Themberchaud flies back across the city toward his lair (aided by Shade's Pass Without Trace), the party huddles in their conquered hideout and tells their incredulous followers what they have instigated. Galax reveals that, back in his quarters in the Keepers' building, he has the other half of a map that is partially inscribed on Yzak in the form of a birthmark. When complete, the map will guide them to what Galax calls the Lost Tomb of Khaem, the resting place of a weapon wielded against their kobold tribe centuries ago by a paladin from the surface world. To reach it, he must traverse the Silken Paths north of Neverlight Grove. The weapon is a powerful sword named Dawnbringer, and Galax hopes that Yzak will wield it, deeming his cause worthy since Yzak now "has his own dragon to worship and serve." Galax declines Yzak's offer to join their motley crew, saying he must stay in Gracklstugh and either serve Themberchaud or be slain by him. He will, however, keep the party's deeds and presence secret.</p>
<p>Alone, Yzak goes back to the Keepers' headquarters, disguised in his great-great-great-grandfather's cloak. There, he finds Grim Herald Morndin Gloomstorm has taken command of the remaining Keepers, having been told not to fail Themberchaud as Gartokkar did. With factions on edge as the city teeters on civil war, the Keepers are fortifying the building against the possibility of an attack from the stone giants. Yzak manages to keep a low profile, retrieving not only his ancestor's map, but stealing what few valuables are in Gartokkar's cell.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ESCAPE</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> <span class="caps">GRACKLSTUGH</span><br>
Armed with Zap's forgery, the party emerges by the Darklake Docks and commandeers three keelboats from Clan Burakrinwurn. Rowing back onto the Darklake, the party again enters the open Underdark, leaving Themberchaud, Deepking Horgar, the Keepers of the Flame, Clan Cairngorm, the Gray Ghosts, the Council of Savants, the Council of Lairds, and the Merchant Council to sort out Gracklstugh. Risking again the perils of the subterranean wilderness and the pursuit of Ilvara Mizzrym and her drow, the heroes plot a course for the myconid haven at Neverlight Grove.</p>

<span class="caps">THE</span> "<span class="caps">DEEPKING</span>"'S <span class="caps">CRUSADE</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the heroes leap onto their commandeered keelboats and shove off the Darklake Docks, they see a hooded duergar – the guard claiming to be Deepking Horgar who has surreptitiously approached them about slaying Themberchaud – bellow that the time has come to rise up against the tyrant wyrm. A ragged crowd rallies around him, a score of mad derro and duergar taking up arms and charging headlong across the city to beard the dragon in his lair. The runaway slaves from Velkynvelve wash their hands of this folly, leaving the city to its fate.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ROPER</span> <span class="caps">ROCK</span><br>
After a few hours following Stool and Shuushar's directions north toward Neverlight Grove, the flotilla is passing by a limestone island when a large stalagmite suddenly sprouts six tendrils, shooting them forth to drag Yzak, Zap, and Zimmerl toward its newly gaping maw – it is a roper, a feared Underdark predator. As the heroes struggle against the strength-sapping venom in the roper's tendrils, stalactites in the cavern roof high above begin falling on their heads. These are piercers, stealthy ambush hunters which are the larvae of ropers, waiting to drop upon the heads of the unwary and feast upon their kills.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883808/Roper.PNG?1532678904"></p>
<p>Zimmerl deflects one of the piercer attacks with subtle mental manipulation, causing the creature to miss him and fall to its death, taking the full brunt of its fall. The other piercers fall easily, but it is the roper that is the true threat. Soon the entire party has been brought into the reach of its deadly bite, with Zap nearly being eaten, but Wandering Shade is able to kill the creature before anyone is devoured. Yzak harvests the gizzard of the monstrosity for its extremely acidic digestive juices, finding some undigested platinum pieces within. Meanwhile Jagh, in giant octopus form, scours the Darklake floor for the sole surviving piercer, capturing it and bringing it aboard in the crazed hopes of raising a roper of his own.</p>
<p>Day 21 – Alturiak 9<br>
<span class="caps">DEMIPLANE</span> OF <span class="caps">DREAD</span><br>
A full eight hours later, Zap is taking a nap as the boats row along when he starts having frightful nightmares, filling him with fear and doubt about the party's prospects for survival in the demon-infested Underdark. Waking fitfully, he mounts Yzak's giant bat Vesper, flying ahead to scout and clear his head. While he does, however, he notices the shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive. Gradually, unconscious of the transition, he finds himself in an eerie realm filled with shadowy forms, cackling, and the waxy corpses of himself, his parents, and his adventuring companions. Reaching out to try and touch his own dead form, Zap is transported back to the "real" world. Reporting back, the others conclude that he was somehow transported to a demiplane, perhaps the dread domain of a powerful night hag. Recalling the legend of Granny Gristlegums, who birthed the dark sisters Nanny Plunk, Maven Delve, and Dame Spiderwort (whose coven was broken by the party on Midwinter, nine days prior), the party again embarks upon a witch hunt, hoping to end her before she can continue to ethereally haunt their dreams.</p>
<p>Taking Zap's same path, the party quickly find themselves in Gristlegums' twisted realm. Here, the surface dwellers of the group are treated to an ersatz glimpse of home, as they see a moon and stars in the night sky above. Approaching a hollowed tree lair in the center of this dark forest, the party is greeted by the grandmother's servants – a pair of flameskulls, floating undead which blast them with flaming rays and Magic Missiles, and even a Fireball once the heroes have moved in close around the stairs into the lair.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883811/Flameskull.PNG?1532679232"><br>
<br>
Vanquishing these guardians, Zap is the first inside the tree, where he finds Granny Gristlegums is not the only hag here: her daughters Matilda Mudwallow and Driftwood Sally, a pair of sea hags, ensorcel Zap. Each bestows a curse upon the hapless deep gnome, rendering him paralyzed to act and more vulnerable to their flesh-flensing claws. One of the sisters calls upon their coven's power to cast a Lightning Bolt at Jagh (in constrictor snake form) and his swarm of summoned vipers, setting fire to the entryway of the hollowed tree.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883810/Sea_Hag.PNG?1532679165"></p>
<p>As her daughters engage the intruders, Granny Gristlegums descends the stairs from above, her eyes darkening to pools of ink as she casts Eyebite, trying to frighten her foes so Matilda and Sally can capitalize upon their horrendous ugliness. Zap is held at bay by his fear, and Zimmerl takes some time to approach the indoor fighting from his position safe in the rear, so it is left to Yzak to use his newfound fiend-fighting proficiency to attack the fallen fey Granny Gristlegums, who proves preternaturally difficult to kill. When Shade kills Driftwood Sally with his spear, breaking the coven, Gristlegums attempts to banish him to a prison demiplane in revenge – extraplanar roots, branches, and vines twist around the tabaxi, but he breaks free through sheer force of personality. When Matilda Mudwallow is slain by Jagh's snakes and Zimmerl is able to enter the fight, the hag grandmother telekinetically throws the heroes about the room like ragdolls, relishing in the might she enjoys in her own lair as Jagh loses concentration on his conjuring spell and his snakes return to their home plane. Zimmerl mentally blasts Gristlegums, wounding her as much in one blow as she had taken previously, and the night hag begs for her life, offering fiendish knowledge of "the Dragon of the Deep" (a black dragon lairing in the Darklake), as well as "the Deepkraken", an ancient titan beast of war which has somehow made its way through the ages to inhabit these subterranean waters. Rather than listen to her witchery, Yzak lops off her head with his scimitars, killing her just as he did her daughters on Midwinter, saying that if she knows anything of use, her head will answer her questions after death without any fiendish lies.<br>

<span class="caps">DARK</span> <span class="caps">TREASURES</span><br>
Transitioning back onto the Material Plane as&nbsp;the legendary hag Granny Gristlegum's demiplane collapses from existence, the heroes examine her belongings, finding her disease-curing heartstone, as well as her soul bag, stitched together from the flesh of a hapless victim. Zap finds that there is an evil soul trapped in the bag, no doubt corrupted and killed by the night hag's ethereal nightmare haunting, and the rogue sews the bag shut. Finally, as Zap casts Mage Hand to remove the severed, leathery derro head from its jar, he sees that its white eyes open as he takes it by its five-foot long, scraggly white beard. Yzak decides to remove it by hand, and discovers that grasping it by the beard allows one to see through the head's eyes. The ranger ties the beard around his wrist for scouting purposes. Grasping Sarith Kzekarit's lifeless fingers around the heartstone does nothing for his condition, which Jigglycloud the flumph laments may be uncurable.</p>

After only about an hour of rowing, the three keelboats are navigating a tight passage when the second of the procession is stuck. As its crew – Zimmerl, Jagh, Glabagool, Jimjar, the catatonic Sarith, and the red dragon wyrmling Hor'lothchath, plus the helpful Yzak and Vesper from the first boat – shove the boat free, they are attacked in the water. Their assailants are quicklings – tiny, hateful fey who dash in too fast for words and, vanishing into an indistinct blur, stab the heroes before they even realize they are under attack.</p>

<p>The quicklings' daggers plunge into the heroes' flesh as they laugh cruelly. Hor'lothchath tests his fire breath for the first time, rendering one of the murderous mischief-makers into ash. The quicklings prove frustratingly difficult to hit, and seem to strike with impunity, but after another falls, revealing their fragility, a bluish-green cloud of gas descends from the rock ledge above and solidifies into a menacing ten-foot tall figure. With its blue skin, stubby ivory horns, and great stature, this is clearly an oni, also known as an ogre mage. The oni stands atop the water's surface as he engages the party.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883815/Oni.PNG?1532679780"></p>
<p>The oni declares that the heroes will die just as they slew those whom he serves – Granny Gristlegums and her coven. Casting Cone of Cold, the oni devastates the party, but sacrifices his two remaining quicklings to do so, turning them into frozen statues with the blast. Jimjar survives only by using one of the quicklings as cover, and is rendered unconscious by the noxious Darklake water he dives into for cover. Vesper is not so lucky. Jagh, in serpent form, coils around the oni as Yzak casts Silence upon the ogre mage, but the druid is disappointed when his foe manifests a glaive and proves to be a competent melee fighter as well. As the serpent and oni are locked in mortal combat, each healing themselves as they clash, Jagh's allies move in to surround the oni, overwhelming its regeneration with sheer brutality.</p>
<p>Zimmerl finds that the ogre mage wore a faintly glowing ring worked out of mithral into the shape of undulating waves. Zap takes this Ring of Water Walking, finding that it wishes him not to be attuned to any other magic items while he wears it – such as the Stonespeaker Crystal. The arcane trickster brushes off the ring's insistence, but it then threatens to use illusion magic to change his appearance. Zap and the ring remain at an impasse.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CHUUL</span> <span class="caps">TRICKERY</span>&nbsp;<br>
Hours later, as only the sleepless dark elf Zimmerl is fully alert while the other heroes recover, the crew of the luckless second keelboat hear a scratching sound on the bottom of their hull. Plunging the hag's derro head into the inky depths, Zimmerl sees a large crayfish-like aberration pinching their vessel with its claws. Recognizing this as a chuul, the amphibious minions of the eons-old aboleth empire which still unquestioningly follow their creators' edicts, Zimmerl contacts the creature telepathically, claiming to be its aboleth master and commanding it to cease what it is doing. Despite a terrible performance from Zimmerl, the gullible chuul believes this order and disappears into the slime of an underwater tunnel to seek its next task. The boats row safely on, and Yzak is able to lure a new giant bat body for the spirit of Vesper.<br>

<p>Day 22 – Alturiak 22&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PASSAGE</span> OF <span class="caps">DOOM</span>&nbsp;<br>
As they near the northwest shore of the Darklake in their 32nd hour of rowing, Shuushar the Awakened casually mentions that they are nearing a geographical feature known as the Passage of Doom – it is not inherently evil, but is a choke point often used by beasts or bandits to ambush mariners. They soon come upon a diamond-shaped islet which has a pyramid of bones in the center, capped by a ram skull which seems to be staring at them. Any doubts of the isle's sinister nature are dispelled when a disintegration ray shoots into the hull of the lead keelboat, causing it to take on water immediately. Its source, a ten-foot wide sphere festooned with eye tendrils, is quickly revealed not to be a true beholder, but a beholder zombie, clinging on to more than a vestige of its native intelligence thanks to the local faerzress. Zap leverages this intelligence to his advantage, as this zombie is susceptible to Tasha's Hideous Laughter.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883817/Beholder_Zombie.PNG?1532679851"></p>
<p>As the zombie beholder rolls around the islet in mirth, four duergar and derro ghasts clamber over the gunwales of the keelboats. Meanwhile Zap has joined Yzak on Vesper's back, scouting over the limestone islet, and decides to jump down to the ground to deal with the laughing beholder as the beastmaster and his bat wheel back around to help the besieged Zimmerl against ghasts. As soon as the deep gnome's feet hit the island, the ram head on top of the bone pyramid turns to face him as he tries to hide behind it. Bones from the shrine assemble themselves into a minotaur skeleton, and four standard humanoid skeletons, so Zap jumps back onto Vesper.</p>
<p>As Jagh – in constrictor snake form – and a fellow python battle ghasts underwater, Zimmerl's air mastery and Yzak's aerial assault deal with the ghasts aboard their keelboat. Zap tries to leap to the next boat up toward the island, but falls into the Darklake below and fails to climb back aboard, so Vesper swoops in to grasp the gnome in his claws and bring him back into the fight on the island. Despite his physical troubles, the arcane trickster's Hideous Laughter spell keeps the beholder zombie incapacitated for much of the skirmish. In a brief moment of cognizance, the beholder lowers itself into the water after Jagh is paralyzed by a ghast, wishing to capitalize on the druid's paralysis with a disintegration ray, but in his undead parroting of life is only able to use his fear ray, which the druid resists. Zimmerl's air mastery breaks apart several of the skeleton warriors, but the minotaur skeleton proves more troublesome, charging the damaged lead keelboat in the shallow waters of the shore to gore it with his horns and cleave it with his greataxe. After all the ghasts and lesser skeletons are destroyed and only the beholder zombie and minotaur skeleton remain, Jagh and his summoned python show their quality by crushing both of the undead until they split at the seams.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SPOILS</span> OF <span class="caps">WAR</span><br>
In the aftermath of battle, keen-eyed Zap Rowsdower notices that, high in the ceiling of this cavern, there is a stalactite with a neatly-carved circular hole in its side. Reasoning that this must have been the living beholder's lair before it became a zombie, the ranger Yzak and the rogue Zap fly up to scout it out on the giant bat Vesper's back. The two find the sprawling stronghold of a paranoid megalomaniac – the lair retains the trophies the beholder had in life, but clearly has been sacked by some adventuring party already. The many traps have been sprung or disarmed, the minions' living quarters lie abandoned, stores of gifts and tools are looted, and escape tunnels are shut off. The heroes believe that this is an excellent place to stay to rest, and perhaps to claim as a stronghold or to ambush Mistress Ilvara and her pursuit party.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VISIONS</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">VAST</span> <span class="caps">OBLIVIUM</span>&nbsp;<br>
Beating Jimjar to the punch, Zap salvages the boat wrecked on the island that belonged to the duergar and derro ghasts before they were undead. Next, the deep gnomes find a patch of gas spore fungi, which Zimmerl investigates just as he did the one containing the memory of a beholder spying upon Drizzt Do'Urden. This time, he finds a vision of a beholder holding a tense negotiation with a group of House Faen Tlabbar drow, who agree to help the beholder with an infestation of deep gnomes in his realm, the Vast Oblivium, so that they can continue home to Menzoberranzan. Zimmerl describes the scene to Zap, who had heard of his parents' sale to Faen Tlabbar merchants from Yzak's poison mentor Maguff, and creates an illusion of his parents which matches the svirfneblin slaves accompanying the drow. Zap is vaguely aware of the Vast Oblivium as a chasm ruled by a beholder named Karazikar, located in the Wormwrithings, a region of the Northdark where purple worms are known to gestate and mature. If this is where Zap's parents are, they are in true peril.</p>

<p>In which the heroes bid farewell to Shuushar and the Darklake, bypassing myconids, a nothic, and an otyugh to reach Neverlight Grove.</p>
<p>Day 23 – Alturiak 11<br>
A <span class="caps">PARTING</span> OF <span class="caps">WAYS</span><br>
After taking refuge in the beholder's lair and retrieving their boats in the morning, the party rows the last couple of hours across the Darklake. Reaching its northwestern shores, the crew finds a hidden grotto and stashes their three keelboats there, Jagh leaving a secret message in Druidic to mark the spot.</p>
<p>As the heroes prepare to press westward toward Neverlight Grove, the kuo-toa mystic&nbsp;Shuushar the Awakened announces his plan to navigate the maze of the Darklake for a time on a spiritual journey, hoping to awaken to a great revelation for his troubled people, which he plans to bring to what is left of Sloobludop. Yzak tries to trick Shuushar into finding peace among the myconids, but the hermit&nbsp;is deadset in his beliefs. Shuushar stops to carve a raft from zurkhwood to begin his meditative wanderings, and the heroes set out to the west.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MYCONID</span> <span class="caps">SCOUTS</span><br>
After wrangling a rothé and capturing it for a steady milk supply, the ranger Yzak is rounding a bend when he runs into three myconid adults headed in the opposite direction. After a brief rapport, Yzak retrieves the others. The adults are glad that Stool and Rumpadump are well, but say that Phylo – one of the two sovereigns of Neverlight – has sent them on secret business. Stool is surprised that they will not even tell him of their mission, being members of the same grove, but the adults explain that Sovereign Phylo has been having them keep mostly to their own circles rather than meld as a grove. Jigglycloud's advanced telepathy is able to intercept the myconids' own mental communications, learning that they are annoyed at having to delay their errand. The flumph, however, is unable to tell what sort of "influence" they might be under when Zap asks him to give a diagnosis, at least not without a lengthy examination. The myconids praise "the Lady", and happily declare that "the day of joy is nigh", and the two groups pass on their own business.<br>

<p>A <span class="caps">SKULKING</span> <span class="caps">DARK</span> <span class="caps">ORACLE</span>&nbsp;<br>
While standing watch that night over the camp, Zimmerl is having a parental talk with his draconic "child" Hor'lathchath when he has the horrific sensation of his flesh beginning to rot off his bones. A single baleful eye peers out from the darkness, its gleam hinting at an unnerving malevolence. Zimmerl recognizes this as a nothic, cursed arcanists who compulsively seek magic items and eldritch secrets with their weird insight. The aberration is quickly put down by Zimmerl, Hor'lathchath, Derendil, and Glabagool, its head exploding when targeted by Zimmerl's mental blast. Zap uses the Stonespeaker Crystal to speak with its corpse (having sewn its jaw back on), finding that this particular nothic was cursed in its mortal life as a wizard seeking godlike power, having discovered the forbidden lore that nothics have no clear sense of purpose, merely an obsessive tug that is a strange lesson for their folly of hubris in life, a false hope to drive them to find more arcane secrets. Ironically, having discovered this truth of nothics, the wizard was cursed to become a nothic himself.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883824/Nothic.PNG?1532680610"></p>
<p>The nothic was on its way to distant Araj, the Tower of Vengeance (retreat of a drow archmage named Vizeran DeVir), hoping to plunder its magical secrets. It is aware of but not very knowledgeable on the topic of "the Lady" mentioned by the myconid Voosbur in the Whorlstone Tunnels, simply saying she protects and provides for all myconids. A Speak With Plants spell cast by Zap with the crystal to the local fungus finds little more, and fails to affect the catatonic Sarith Kzekarit, but learns that a group of "softers" (non-myconid humanoids) passed this way in the last tenday or so – and after some prodding discovers that they were drow. Zap has heard of Araj, and knows that Vizeran DeVir is a Lolth-hating outcast from drow society.</p>
<p>Day 24 – Alturiak 12<br>
<span class="caps">AMBUSHING</span> A <span class="caps">VROCK</span><br>
Halfway through the next day of following Stool's directions through the Underdark, Yzak (scouting ahead) spots a a vulture-like demon – a vrock – feasting upon a humanoid's bones while perched on a cliff. Despite its stunning screech and poisonous spores, the vrock is overwhelmed by a stealth attack, and is painfully returned to the Abyss by the crushing coils of Jagh, shifted into constrictor snake shape.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OTYUGH</span> IN <span class="caps">OFFAL</span>&nbsp;<br>
While sizing up an offal mound in a small cavern they mean to rest in, Yzak is grabbed by a huge tentacle ending in a leaf-like frond, which is attached to a bloated, three-legged, ovoid creature – one of the shuffling, gluttonous scavengers called otyughs. The grotesque, bloated creature tries to crush and devour the heroes, and Zap briefly contracts filth fever, but Jagh and a conjured cave bear are able to finish the punishment dealt out by the others. Yzak cuts through the aberration's rocky hide, sifting through the offal, carrion, manure, scum, and trash in its stomach to find a sturdy shield with an eye adorned on its front – a Sentinel Shield, enchanted to increase its wielder's wariness. Zimmerl's psychic investigation determines its duergar Clan Thrazgad smith also caused the shield to faintly glow when near mind flayers.<br>

<p>Day 25 – Alturiak 13<br>
<span class="caps">ARRIVING</span> AT <span class="caps">NEVERLIGHT</span> <span class="caps">GROVE</span><br>
After a day's travel blissfully free of assault, the heroes follow Stool's intuition after a drying underground stream down a tunnel dimly lit by glowing lichen. Entering the cavern of the grove, the heroes leave the horrors of the Underdark behind, finding a hidden enchanted place – they are treated to a panoramic view of a strangely alien but serenely beautiful mushroom forest which covers every surface, including the cavern ceiling, and illuminates the darkness with brilliantly colorful bio-luminescent patterns. On the other side of this exotic forest, beyond a ravine and clouded in mist, they glimpse a majestic mushroom tower that hints at wonder and mystery to be explored. Perhaps this is the safe place to rest, recuperate, and resupply that the heroes have sought since breaking free from the chains of the drow.<br>

<p>In which the heroes uncover the horror that lies beneath the tranquil surface in Neverlight Grove.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CHAPTER</span> 5: <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MYCONID</span> <span class="caps">HAVEN</span>&nbsp;<br>
Day 25 – Alturiak 13 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
RE-<span class="caps">AWAKENING</span>&nbsp;<br>
Sarith Kzekarit, still catatonic around Prince Derendil's neck, blinks his eyes as he returns to lucidity. He is aghast that he has been comatose for so long, but is pleased that they have finally arrived at Neverlight Grove, a place of safety where they can plan their next move. The dark elf is irate, however, when the party refuses to lower him from the hulking quaggoth's neck, saying that his consciousness is proof that he is no longer ill.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SHAMBLER</span> <span class="caps">ASSAULT</span><br>
Coming into the wondrous cavern of Neverlight Grove, the heroes note that there are no myconids to be seen in the many-colored light bathing their hidden haven. Instead, four drow can be seen slowly walking toward them. Meanwhile strange singing can be faintly heard echoing from the cavern beyond the grove, just loud enough to be noticeable. Zimmerl can see from a distance that the drow are covered in mushrooms and yellow mold – they are spore servants. While spore servants are common in myconid life, the heroes prepare themselves in case these are the corrupted ones like those encountered in the Whorlstone Tunnels. As they look on, a shambling mound arises – an all-consuming devourer of animated decaying leaves, branches and vines forming from the plentiful compost in the fungal wilds on the edge of the grove. The mound lashes out with its branches, breaking the back of a spore servant as its vines drag another within its dense bulk to be smashed and smothered into mulch.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883827/Shambling_Mound.PNG?1532681208"></p>
<p>Yzak decides that it would be wise to convince the (barely) sentient mound that the heroes are friendly toward it, but when Zimmerl reaches out telepathically he finds that the plant has no knowledge of language. Thus Zimmerl turns to Stool, whose rapport spores can communicate with any known being. And yet, to use them, the little sprout must be quite near. And so Zap, sneaking toward the shambler through the thick fungal undergrowth, uses Mage Hand to levitate the fearful sprout out of reach of the mound's attacks, in order to shake rapport spores down and establish contact with the thing. Stool bravely goes along with this plan, risking its life on the doorsteps of home after a perilous journey through the Underdark. The shambling mound, destroying the remaining spore servants, is baffled when it experiences communication for the first time in its existence. Stool, however, fails to convince the walking weed that the heroes could provide it with any richer stalking ground than Neverlight Grove, and Zimmerl begins combat with an acidic ray. Zap tosses Stool to safety and charges into melee, and is promptly engulfed by the mound after the shambler throws off his Tasha's Hideous Laughter. Some lucky crossbow shots from Yzak pierce through the horror's ponderous form and strike its central root-stem, and a spear thrust from Shade returns it to dormancy. Zap senses that the swamp thing is feigning death, and with a remorseless stab to its root-stem finishes off the resurgent menace, destroying the instinct that drives its hunger.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MEETING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MYCONIDS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having seen yellow mold on the spore servants, Yzak fears contact with its spores, and suggests everyone take the preventative measure of burning themselves to remove them. Rather than blast everyone with his rays, Zimmerl turns to one of the zurkhwood mushrooms forming a living palisade at the grove's entrance and shoots it with an acid ray, hoping to blast it down to chop into firewood. Everyone is quite shocked when the 30-ft tall fungus uproots itself and begins to walk toward him. Stool says this must be one of the awakened zurkhwoods which guard the grove, and this time his diplomatic talents win the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Zimmerl – whose elven perception is bolstered by his Sentinel Shield – notices eyes blinking on the caps of many of the giant toadstools nearby. The party sees several circles of myconids stand in unison, each gathered around a mound of rocks and soil festooned with mold, mushrooms, and lichen. The leader of the nearest group – the Circle of Hunters – introduces itself as Loobamub. It is at first apprehensive regarding these clearly armed outsiders, especially at Hor'lathchath's screeches and hisses, but the red wyrmling flies off to survey the grove from one of the many terraces. Loobamub is pleased that the party has destroyed the shambling mound, which it says has been exhausting the grove's soil, and had to be put down for the good of the colony. When the heroes say this battle was nothing to them, Loobamub happily tells them that a grick alpha and its pack have been terrorizing the myconids, and they would earn the sovereigns' trust if they could bring the alpha's body to them for animation as a spore servant.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DUAL</span> <span class="caps">SOVEREIGNS</span>&nbsp;<br>
The heroes have questions for Loobamub regarding the grove's two sovereigns, to which the hunter circle leader tells them that Basidia was once a nomadic sovereign who arrived here two years ago, joining its two circles (Loobamub's own Hunters, and the Circle of Explorers led by Rasharoo) to Phylo's five-circle colony. The two have become great friends and have ruled in concert ever since then, in the sure and certain knowledge that a myconid only has so long in this life, and that a new sovereign will rise to guide the colony after they have returned to nourish the soil. Phylo, however, has been acting erratically lately, and has called for the nightly melding to occur only between members of the same circles, with only the circle leaders being allowed to meld with the sovereigns. This, Phylo says, will ensure the efficiency of the myconids. Loobamub says that this is contrary to the teachings of the myconid deity Psilofyr, but rather than get into criticizing its colony-mates, Loobamub says that the two sovereigns should be the ones to speak for the grove, and sends the errant heroes toward the central basin.</p>
<p>Walking through the abundant fecundity and otherworldly light of the underground marsh, the heroes approach the sovereigns Phylo and Basidia, whose caps sway some 12 feet from the ground. The sovereigns are attended by a trio of myconid adult councilors, and are protected by ten awakened zurkhwoods. Sovereign Phylo spreads his rapport spores and welcomes the travelers with honest enthusiasm, thanking them for returning the lost sprouts Stool and Rumpadump to their home. It is interested in Wandering Shade's tales of his homeland Maztica, but deflects the heroes' own questions: Phylo speaks in glowing terms of a coming "day of joy", but politely asks the party not to visit the grove's eastern plateau just yet, saying "a wondrous and glorious surprise" is being prepared there, and they should not ruin the reveal for themselves. It offers the party a peek tomorrow if they want, an offer which Sarith advises they should accept, since keeping on the sovereigns' good side will help them in the long run – the heroes tell Sarith to shut up. Phylo also goes on about how "the Great Seeder" who lives in the eastern plateau can answer all of their questions, saying she is a great and powerful Lady who protects and provides for all myconids, but declines to say who she actually is, insisting it is important the heroes experience her presence firsthand. Despite persistent questioning from the heroes, Phylo declines to tell any more, saying the Lady's ideas are "too incredible" to be absorbed at once.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883829/Myconid-Basidia.PNG?1532681306"></p>
<p>Sovereign Basidia volunteers to show the heroes around the grove, giving a guided tour. As they walk around to meet all the circle leaders, they engage in a private rapport, with Stool mentioning that the harmony between the sovereigns is off, and Basidia is uncomfortable with Phylo's behavior. Stool also noticed that Phylo used the feminine form when referring to the Lady/Great Seeder, when myconids normally have little concept of gender, and furthermore that Psilofyr teaches the fungus folk to care little for the future, and Phylo's obsession with the coming "day of joy" is unusual. Basidia immediately warns them against staying in Neverlight for too long, telling of a group of "softers" (eventually determined to be drow) who arrived a few cycles ago. These softers were taken to the Garden of Welcome, and Basidia hasn't seen them since. When asked about Sarith's spores, Basidia senses their alien and corrupt nature, but knows only that it hasn't encountered them before – very unusual. Furthermore, the Circle of Masters led by Yestabrod has been sending scouts outside the grove without telling anyone else and has been taking most of the carcasses brought home by the Circle of Hunters, and Yestabrod itself has not been melding with the rest of the Inner Circle, instead sending a representative.</p>
<p>When Zimmerl asks why Basidia doesn't kill Phylo or start a civil war against its fellow sovereign, Basidia explains that internal strife is alien to Psilofyr's teachings, and instead Basidia tries to change Phylo's way of thinking in the nightly melding. Basidia expresses its fear that Phylo has contracted some sort of "diseased spore", and a clue to the spore's nature might be found in the Garden of Welcome. Lest Basidia itself or any of its followers fall victim to the infection, the sovereign asks the heroes to investigate the garden. As a sign of friendship, Basidia gives the heroes a Scroll of Protection Against Fiends, offering to brew a Potion of Gaseous Form for Zimmerl out of mosses and molds, and promising more treasure should they succeed.</p>
<p>In their ambulations, Basidia points out the circle leaders loyal to it (Loobamub of the Hunters, Rasharoo of the Explorers, and Hebopbe of the Growers), and those loyal to Phylo (Gasbide of the Builders, Yrberop of the Sporers, and Yestabrod of the newly-formed Circle of Masters). Gasbide, the architect of the Grove, demands descriptions of their home cultures' strucutres, bristling in an excitement seldom seen in myconids as it asks for exasperatingly minor details such as precise dimensions of bricks or the density of lumber. Gasbide reveals that it dreams of building an elaborate, bizarre fungal palace that breaks through the Underdark to the mythical surface world (a distance Jagh knows to be some five miles!) with "the aid of Araumycos." Gasbide seems to have no conscious knowledge of what Araumycos is (the largest living organism perhaps in the world, a region of interconnected fungal intelligence), sensing only that it is part of the great celebration to come.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884378/Neverlight_Grove.PNG?1532802155"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ending their tour at the circle mound of the Sporers, the party and Basidia are approached by Yrberop. The circle leader seems to sway to music only it can hear, an internal cacophony which the heroes hear a faint echo of once they are in rapport. Yrberop is enthusiastic about Phylo's plan to spread the happiness brought by the Great Seeder to everyone in the Underdark and beyond, and tells Stool and Rumpadump to spread their reproduction spores far and wide. Stool haltingly objects that this is against Psilofyr's teachings of delicate balance to be carefully maintained, but Yrberop simply says that Stool is not yet an adult and does not yet understand. When challenged why it is rebelling against its deity's ways, Yrberop loses track of the conversation and begins talking to the tiny newly-spored myconids in its charge, singing a lullaby of the Great Seeder and "her" upcoming wedding to the Great Body, and how every myconid is invited, bringing joy to all in the world below and above.</p>
<p>Beyond Yrberop's breeding ground is a narrow path leading up to the Garden of Welcome on the eastern plateau. Basidia addresses the two chuul spore servants guarding the path, telling them to allow the heroes passage – but the spore servants remain motionless without Yrberop's permission, which the circle leader does not grant, even at Sovereign&nbsp;Basidia's request. Rather than force conflict with its fellow myconids, the shaken Basidia retreats to the central basin, leaving the heroes sure that its fears are concrete. Zimmerl asks Yrberop what would happen if he killed Yrberop, hoping to transfer command of the spore servants to Stool, but determines that they would remain loyal to Phylo as the animating sovereign. For this reason the heroes decide that Basidia should be the one to animate the grick alpha, and go off to hunt the beast before entering the Garden of Welcome.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GRICK</span> <span class="caps">HUNT</span>&nbsp;<br>
As Basidia goes to brew Zimmerl's potion, Yzak leads the group as he easily tracks the grick pack through the fungal wilds, ignoring a rank scent of decay. Following the furrows of the wormlike predators through the soggy ground, the ranger finds that three common gricks have slithered up to the cavern ceiling, where Zimmerl spots them coiled around stalactites. The alpha, their true quarry, lurks out of sight on a terrace, having squeezed into a crevice to lie in wait. Zimmerl blasts gricks off of the ceiling with psionically-focused air, as Jagh joins the melee fighters in sabertooth tiger form. Zap's magical dagger and Shade's qi-infused claws tear through the slaughterous worms as they rear up, their four barbed tentacles unfurling to reveal their hungry, snapping beaks.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883830/Grick.PNG?1532681571"></p>
<p><span class="caps">UMBER</span> <span class="caps">HULK</span> <span class="caps">ATTACK</span>!<br>
The heroes look down after the grick alpha falls, seeing the chitinous body of an umber hulk. Noting their wounds and the burrow on the terrace wall from which the monstrosity emerged, the mind-scrambled heroes deduce they must have slain the abominable horror. Though they remember precious little of the attack thanks to the hulk's bewildering gaze, myconid witnesses describe the umber hulk exploding out from the terrace wall in a shower of earth and rock, attacking the unsuspecting party with its claws and mandibles. Luckily, Zap was able to incapacitate the devious delver with Tasha's Hideous Laughter, and its gaze had little effect apart from confusing their memory of the event.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">SCOUTING</span> <span class="caps">YGGMORGUS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Unnerved by Phylo's changes to Neverlight, especially considering the demonic incursions in Velkynvelve, Sloobdludop, and Gracklstugh, the party decides that even staying one night in the grove may be too much, and resolves to see what is going on in the eastern plateau against Phylo's wishes. With the myconids on a strict daily schedule – evenly divided into work, melding, and sleep – the heroes know they have several hours until the nightly meld, when the myconids gather in their circles to experience a shared dream for entertainment and social interaction. They also fear that whatever "diseased spore" has affected Phylo and its supporters will doubtless spread during the meld, and that Phylo's promised surprise will be sinister in nature. So resolved, Zap mounts Vesper with Yzak's blessings, and stealthily flies through the stalactites and fungal growths covering the ceiling toward Yggmorgus, the mist-shrouded titanic tower of fungus that dominates the eastern plateau. As the svirfneblin approaches the majestic mushroom, he flies over the Garden of Welcome, seeing several myconids and spore servants tending to various corpses – not unheard of in myconid society. He also hears murmuring, which is unusual in the grove since myconids communicate only via their rapport spores.</p>
<p>Flying on, Zap lands Vesper on one of the thousands of smaller fungi clinging to the main stalk of Yggmorgus, hearing a cacophony of atonal music echoing within, and sensing a stench of rot and decay which threatens to penetrate his flesh and pervade his soul. Eerie luminescence leaks out of slitted windows. Before looking in, Zap peers down on the cavern floor, seeing a ledge covered with a carpet of moss and fungi, scores of variously-sized lumps, and pockmarks where pools of vile fluids suppurate and ooze, some drying out and scabbing over. Looking closer, Zap sees the shapes of writhing creatures inside each lump. Most are humanoid, but there are also gricks, nothics, and giant spiders. As if on cue, one of the closer lumps in this Great Garden of Rot bubbles up and bursts. A dense cloud of spores and dark, reeking fluid explodes, even as the rogue hears a piercing scream of agony and terror. Inside the pockmark left behind is a drow – or what is left of one. Other than a face, long white hair, and a breastplate, it is impossible to tell where the drow ends, and the rot and fungi consuming him begins. The drow feebly thrashes, his screams rising higher and higher in pitch, until he locks eyes with Zap and abruptly stops screaming. A brief moment of lucidity replaces his terror, even as his eyes roll back in his head in some kind of bizarre euphoria as he goes limp and slowly sinks back down into the fungal muck. Having witnessed this, and by simple proximity to Yggmorgus, Zap loses his mind, believing now that he can see things that no one else can see. Throughout the entire eastern plateau, loud moans and cries of agony answer the drow's screams in a terrifying and deafening chorus, drowning out all other sounds until eventually winding down into a low susurration of groans and burbles. The entire stalk of the giant mushroom seems to shudder, almost as if in ecstasy.<br>

<p><span class="caps">HOLDING</span> <span class="caps">PALAVER</span><br>
A manic Zap returns to the group's camp at the shores of the pool in the fungal wilds, near the circle mound of the Hunters, where Yzak has been skinning gricks and Zimmerl is in meditation. Jimjar approaches Zap, reminding his fellow gnome that today is the 13th of the month, a day in which even the deep gnomes have muted expressions of joke-telling contests, communal meals, dancing, prayers, and storytelling&nbsp;<br>
to honor Garl Glittergold. Blissfully unaware of the grove's dangers and looking forward to the night's meld, the gambler asks Zap if he thinks two deep gnomes on the run can show these fungus folk how to dance. Zap frantically dismisses this, and suggests the party flee in the face of what he has seen at Yggmorgus. When no one is able to get straight facts from the arcane trickster, Jagh steels himself and suggests that Zap show him an illusory representation of what he witnessed. Resisting the call of madness upon seeing the rotting drow, Jagh tells the others what has transpired, and Yzak insists they must investigate immediately, in order to save what souls they can before they suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>There is talk of an aerial assault on Yggmorgus itself, armed with alchemists' fire and dragonsbreath, but the sheer mass of the fungal tower makes such a bombing run unlikely. In the end a stealth approach is decided upon, with Zimmerl and Zap mounted upon Hor'lathchath, Yzak on Vesper's back, and Jagh in spider form on the ceiling, all of them cloaked in shadows thanks to Yzak's Pass Without Trace spell. Their followers do not wish to be left at camp surrounded by myconids during this action: Sarith wishes to see the garden himself if they are to go against Phylo's wishes, and Prince Derendil is mightily disappointed that he cannot lead a diversionary ground assault on the Garden of Welcome as they make their approach. When Zimmerl approaches his "daughter" Hor'lathchath, who is still surveying the cavern imperiously, she is delighted at the prospect of subjugating these docile fungus folk as thralls, laying waste to those who resist, and claiming their treasures for her hoard.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GARDEN</span> OF <span class="caps">HORROR</span>&nbsp;<br>
As they make good on their plan (with an hour left until the nightly meld), the group passes over the Garden of Welcome, which rises higher than the other terraces and is screened by a natural fence of soaring zurkhwood stalks. Here Zimmerl's keen ears notice a female drow crying out in Undercommon: "Please…kill me!". This pierces through a symphony of moans, cries, and hisses that the less perceptive party members cannot hear at this range. The source of these sounds are the heads of creatures of a dozen Underdark races peeking from the ground, mold and fungi growing around them.</p>
<p>Noting the three myconids and two drow spore servants tending this "garden", Zimmerl thinks that a quick dive attack should be able to wipe them out and fulfill this drow's wish for death, despite knowing that Neverlight Grove is small enough that myconid distress spores will alert every myconid there that the garden is under attack. Hor'lathchath and Vesper swoop down, and between flame breath and the riders' attacks, all of their foes are quickly defeated – except for one. Yestabrod, leader of the Circle of Masters, has become a monstrosity hardly recognizable as a myconid. It looks like a fungal larva slithering along the ground, with mold and lichen growing in hypnotic patterns along its ringed stalk, and puffs of spores leaking from a slit resembling a mouth. The drow, trapped in her horrible fate, feebly raises a spider medallion half-embedded in the bloated growth that was once her hand. Half her face is rotten and pustulate, a bed for the sprouting of scores of tiny mushrooms. "The Great Seeder," she says, "…trap…she's here…the Lady of Decay…Zuggtmoy…". Not only Demogorgon, it seems, but at least two demon lords prowl the Underdark.</p>
<p>As the moans of the garden's victims suddenly take on a new tone of fear, Yestabrod takes delight in toying with the trespassers. The master of the foul garden speaks, its voice gurgling and spitting as it communicates both in their mind, and aloud in the Abyssal tongue: "Welcome, travelers! Are you here for the wedding rehearsal? Friends of the bride or her intended? No matter! Let the love of the Great Seeder embrace you as you become one with her chosen, the Great Body!" The aberrant myconid uses its necrotic powers to explode the corpses of its fallen allies, badly wounding Jagh in a blast of gore and acid even as Yestabrod is healed by the essence of death. Yestabrod also fires a cloud of caustic spores at the aerial attackers, which they quickly shake off to avoid further acidic burns. The evil circle leader pummels Jagh with its toxic fists, even as it is immune to Jagh's own spider form poison. But soon enough, the outnumbered minion of Zuggtmoy is overwhelmed, and a critical stab from Zap causes him to explode. A cloud of infestation spores is released from Yestabrod's demon-tainted body, which infects the luckless rogue with The Spores of Zuggtmoy, as well as a mad compulsion to keep everything that he finds.</p>
<p>Zimmerl turns to the dying drow, taking the young acolyte's holy symbol of Lolth. Saying her name is Xinaya, she begs Zimmerl to warn Menzoberranzan that the Demon Queen of Fungi is in the Underdark, seemingly unaware of the madness that has already erupted there in the form of Demogorgon. Xinaya also asks her fellow drow to tell her family – House Masq'il'yr – that she died bravely scouting the Underdark. Recognizing the name (eight days prior, Zimmerl had incited the riot in Gracklstugh that got Xinaya's sister Xarith Masq'il'yr arrested and presumably executed by the duergar Stoneguard) and assuming that Xinaya had been sent here by Ilvara Mizzrym to keep watch for the runaway slaves, Zimmerl whispers "I killed your sister," before putting Xinaya out of her misery. Finding Xinaya's treasure heaped in a pile, the heroes are surprised to find a magical sword, armor, and a Bag of Holding.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WEDDING</span> <span class="caps">REHEARSAL</span><br>
After the confrontation with Yestabrod, the heroes hear sound and movement from the cavern of Yggmorgus to the northeast. Echoes spill from the misty cavern, a cacophony of wheezing voices join in discordant music as the remaining heads in the Garden of Welcome begin to croak and groan, joining the horrible song. Stepping through the mist, there is a parade of some 18 once-humanoid things lost in their own reveries as they conduct an obscene ritual – a sort of parody of a wedding ceremony. Zuggtmoy's thralls, with clusters of glowing lichen and tumescent growths forming chaotic patterns on their decaying flesh, their voices stabbing into the heroes' minds, both insane and gleeful in equal parts, sing the following song:&nbsp;<br>
"From rocky bed the toadstool rose,<br>
From chaos dark, her love She shows.&nbsp;<br>
Wish! Yearn! Laugh!<br>
The Lady will be wed!<br>
Crave! Hunger! Dance!<br>
Her joyous spores will spread!<br>
Youth is gone, beauty rots,<br>
Araumycos and Zuggtmoy!<br>
Joined together, heart to heart,<br>
Becoming one 'til death do part!<br>
Hail! Hail! Hail!"</p>
<p>Zuggtmoy herself – the Lady of Rot and Decay and the Demon Queen of Fungi – is seemingly within Yggmorgus right here in Neverlight Grove, corrupting the myconids with her infecting spores, and plotting to somehow "wed" Araumycos, the vast territory of interconnected, psionic fungus located southeast of the Darklake and beneath the High Forest. Araumycos is a fungal organism the size of a kingdom, believed to be both the oldest and largest living thing on the world of Toril. If Zuggtmoy is allowed to form some unholy union with Araumycos, the Material Plane may not be ready for the consequences.</p>

<span class="caps">WEDDING</span> <span class="caps">REHEARSAL</span> (cont.)<br>
As the heroes look on, the bridesmaids and chamberlains of Zuggtmoy enact a mock wedding between their demon queen and Araumycos, with three spore servants rising from the Garden of Welcome, carrying the burst-open corpse of the mutant myconid Yestabrod and moving it like a puppet to play the part of priest. The onlooking heroes experiences a vision: the inside of a great tower filled with spiraling stairs and balconies, and glowing patches of mold. In the center floats a vaguely feminine figure, made entirely of fungus and mold. This figure, triple the height of her attendants, floats serenely as her servants sing a strange song, weaving her substance into delicate lichen veils and a long mycelium train like a bridal gown.<br>
<br>

<p>Snapping out of the vision as the ceremony ends, the heroes court with madness.The thralls of Zuggtmoy file back toward Yggmorgus, ignoring the party as they are lost in their reverie, the spore servants bearing the broken body of Yestabrod. The heroes attack the entourage, Jagh opening with an Entangle spell, leaving the lines of attendants vulnerable to Zimmerl's blasts of air and his draconic daughter Hor'lathchath's gleeful fire breath. The frail bridesmaids blast hallucinatory and infesting spores at the heroes, and teleport around the field by striding through the chamberlains to various fungus patches. Though they are easily destroyed, the bridesmaids are able to infect several heroes with the Spores of Zuggtmoy. The much tougher chamberlains – vaguely bipedal masses of blue mold with the barest hint of a face nested deep inside a mossy cowl – pummel Shade, Vesper, and Jagh (in cave bear form) – with their mossy fists as Yzak and Zap assassinate the spore servants bearing Yestabrod's form. Every melee strike against a chamberlain risks contact with toxic spores, but eventually the large fungal creatures are defeated.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="caps">MAD</span> <span class="caps">DANCE</span><br>
As battle concludes, the heroes decide to tell Sovereign Basidia of what they have found, but first to actually enter Yggmorgus to find what they may. Agreeing it best to risk the sanity of only one hero, Jagh shifts into spider form and crawls through the Great Garden of Rot to the titanic mushroom tower. Meanwhile Zimmerl shoots fiery rays around the garden and onto Yggmorgus, setting fire to some of the thousands of lesser fungi branching off its main stalk, and destroying many of the scores of lumps containing writhing humanoids doomed to become Zuggtmoy's thralls.</p>
<p>Descending to the cavern's lower basin, Jagh sees a spectacle of unspeakable horror: scores of deformed creatures dance around the base of Yggmorgus, a motley collection of humanoids and Underdark creatures, all sporting tumors, cankers, and putrid patches of flesh. They are joined by dancing fungi twisted into vaguely humanoid forms. Jagh hears voices cackling and chatting amiably about Sovereign Phylo's success at "bringing so many new guests to attend the party!" He sees drow dancing as if their bones were melting, duergar roaring with mock merriment and vomiting slime, and even nothics laughing madly as they leap and caper. Observing for a few moments, Jagh sees a form rising up out of the fungal muck: the drow scout whose terrible end he witnessed thanks to Zap's illusory representation. The drow wades out of the muck to join the other revelers in their decadence. Upon witnessing this grotesquery, the druid fends off madness once again and decides to trespass further.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GREAT</span> <span class="caps">PALACE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Entering Yggmorgus itself, Jagh finds its internal layout simple enough, reminiscent of the vision just experienced during the wedding rehearsal: a hollowed-out mushroom stalk making a towering central hall in which Zuggtmoy herself floats, attended by her bridesmaids, who sing as they weave the gown to prepare the bride-to-be for her coming day of joy. Though the Lady of Rot and Decay remains immobile, Jagh hears her speak in Abyssal to her thralls. After a few moments, the spying spider-druid is terrified as Zuggtmoy flicks her eyes open, turning them directly on him as she releases a cloud of mind control spores in his direction, mentally commanding him to leave the tower. A group of bridesmaids on the ground floor chase him out, wailing and scolding him about how unlucky it is to see the bride before it is time.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MELD</span><br>
As the heroes leave the madness of the eastern plateau, they worry that the distress spores of Yestabrod's myconids will have alerted the rest of the infected myconids of danger. Flying or crawling through the stalactites and hanging moss on the cavern ceiling, the party sees that this is apparently not so, and that the fungus folk are docilely returning to their circle mounds after a day's work to prepare for the nightly meld. The party lands in the central basin as the Inner Circle gathers – both sovereigns, plus&nbsp;the circle leaders. The slain Yestabrod of the Circle of Masters has not been attending meetings, and in its stead the party finds Voosbur, the myconid which they met in the Whorlstone Tunnels beneath Gracklstugh. Joining the meld as the myconids share rapport and hallucination spores for this shared dream, Zimmerl also establishes a private telepathic link with Sovereign Basidia, telling it that the source of the diseased spores infecting Phylo and its followers is none other than Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, who is right here in Neverlight Grove. In the face of this terrible truth, Basidia agrees it has no choice but to leave the colony, but first must make one last effort to convince others to leave with it.</p>
<p>As the meld begins, Jagh wastes no time in announcing Zuggtmoy's corrupting presence, and accuses Sovereign Phylo of consorting with demons. Phylo blissfully welcomes its madness with childlike innocence, reveling in corruption with a sense of wonder and joy, unable to grasp the evil it has embraced. Phylo is disappointed that the heroes have chosen to ruin the surprise of the day of joy for themselves, but hopes they will still attend the Fetid Wedding between Zuggtmoy and Araumycos, "the true union that will unite us all, and bring joy to the worlds above and below." Basidia says that it will no longer rule over a divided colony, and that it cannot accept the perversions of Psilofyr's divine teachings of simple shared joys, and will abandon the grove to return to the nomadic lifestyle it led up until arriving in Neverlight two years ago. Rasharoo of the Circle of Explorers and Loobamub of the Hunters stand with Basidia. But the naive and sharing myconids are extremely vulnerable to Zuggtmoy's influence, and Hebopbe of the Circle of Growers has been seduced by Phylo's insidious promise of perpetual rot and transcendent dreams of never-ending melding – generous and wondrous gifts from the Lady of Decay. As Zimmerl shoots a line in the ground with a ray of fire for loyalists to cross, Hebopbe joins Gasbide, Voosbur, and Yrberop at Phylo's side. Sovereign Phylo makes no attempt to stop Basidia or the heroes from leaving, still convinced the cause it embraces is one of joy and prosperity for the folk of the grove. Basidia, Rasharoo, and Loobamub leave the meld to go gather their followers.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SUMMONS</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PUDDING</span> <span class="caps">KING</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the party walks back to their camp at the pool in the fungal wilds, the telepathic gelatinous cube Glabagool is quivering as it contacts them mentally. Glabagool says "Zuggtmoy…here," somehow having sensed the demon lord. When the party has no immediate idea of how to drive her off or defeat her, Glabagool says that someone called "the Pudding King" might have the answer. Zimmerl recalls that the Oozing Temple outside Sloobludop where they found Glabagool was devoted to the Faceless Lord Juiblex, the Oozing Hunger, and that Juiblex is a demon lord of oozes who battles Zuggtmoy for control of a layer of the Abyss. Who this "Pudding King" might be, however, is unknown. Glabagool squeezes itself through an inch-wide hole in the ground, saying it intends to find the Pudding King "in the north" and find some way to work against Zuggtmoy. The flumph Jigglycloud agrees that if there are multiple demon lords in the Abyss, they must find allies.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">UNMOURNED</span> <span class="caps">DEATH</span> OF <span class="caps">SARITH</span> <span class="caps">KZEKARIT</span>&nbsp;<br>
As Yzak begins to plan their path out of the grove, the murdering drow Sarith (still suspended around Prince Derendil's neck) voices his opinion that they should remain here to bask in the glory of the Lady when he screams in agony. The party can only watch as the drow's head splits open, releasing a cloud of infecting spores as he dies and is transformed into a spore servant. His animated corpse swings slamming fists into Derendil, who responds with a frenzy of quaggoth savagery, prying off Sarith's head with his claws and hurling it into the pool. Never quite sure if the sullen dark elf actually did murder his fellow guard at Velkynvelve or if the accusation was simply a setup to discredit and destroy him, the party leaves his dead form to nourish the rich soil of the grove.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">EXODUS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Some forty myconids gather around Sovereign Basidia as it prepares to lead an exodus from Neverlight Grove. Asking Zimmerl (who Basidia calls the heroes' "circle leader") what Stool and Rumpadump will do, the mystic responds that their circle has no leader, and it is up to the sprouts to decide. Having braved many terrors of the Underdark to come home only to find the grove corrupted by demons, its harmony broken, Stool finds itself drawn to follow Basidia and rejoin its people, and its buddy Rumpadump follows suit. Basidia says it will head toward its old home Sporedome, far to the east beneath the Dalelands and Moonsea, but if it ever finds any lore to prevent the Fetid Wedding or weaken Zuggtmoy's hold on the fungus folk, the heroes will be the first to know. The newly-nomadic myconids bid farewell to the heroes and, bearing the corpses of the grick alpha and the umber hulk for Basidia to animate, they strike out to the east. The heroes likewise leave the corrupted grove behind, opting to follow the map Yzak has pieced together from his birthmark and the secrets shared by his great-great-grandfather Galax'Arix'Taklak'Hagnar'Irtos'Sniv'Kashak'Meepo.</p>
<p>Day 26 – Alturiak 14&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">KABOOM</span><br>
Setting up camp less than a mile from Neverlight, the heroes adjust their sentry schedule to reflect the loss of several followers. Zimmerl and Jagh are standing watch in the wee hours of the morn when they spot a band of three myconids, and four drow and quaggoth spore servants. The servants each carry an armload of torchstalks, the combustible exotic fungus of the Underdark. The myconid leader spreads rapport spores and asks if the heroes have visited Neverlight Grove and met its exalted leader, Sovereign Phylo. It is surprised when the heroes say they have, and have even entered Yggmorgus and been invited to the Lady's wedding. The myconid says that it has no idea what the fungus it carries is for, only that its circle leader Yestabrod asked it to harvest them. It goes on to grant Zimmerl permission when he asks to "try something" with them, to which he responds with a fiery ray, lighting an armload of torchstalks, setting off a chain reaction of explosions as they detonate, utterly destroying the band of Phylo followers.</p>
<p>Day 27 – Alturiak 15&nbsp;<br>
The day passes without any perilous trials, a rare enough occurrence in the Underdark. The party thank their gods of light.</p>
<p>Day 28 – Alturiak 16<br>
<span class="caps">MIMIC</span> <span class="caps">AMBUSH</span>!&nbsp;<br>
In the "morning", the heroes arrive at the edge of a vast fissure crisscrossed with large strands of spiderwebs. Deducing this may be the Silken Paths that Yzak's ancestor spoke of, the beastmaster mounts his bat and flies downward to plumb the chasm's depths. Finding it to be some 500 feet deep, Yzak scours the bottom for any treasure-laden bodies that may have fallen off the paths. Though he does find the broken forms of several drow and quaggoths, it is an iron chest entangled in webs that catches his kobold eye. Returning to the ledge, he fetches Zap to investigate. While the rogue checks for traps, he is surprised when his hand sticks to its side and the chest opens its lid to reveal a hungry mouth. The shapechanging predator tries to drag him into its mouth, its teeth and acidic spittle stinging his flesh, but with Yzak and Vesper's help the rogue escapes this fate, destroying the mimic as it is wracked by Tasha's Hideous Laughter.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WEB</span> <span class="caps">RUNNERS</span><br>
Meanwhile Shade, Jagh, and Zimmerl spot a pair of goblins who appear to be gliding down a diagonal strand of web at insane speeds. The goblins seem to be thrill-seekers, hooting with glee and congratulating each other on risky leaps from strand to strand. Zimmerl rides the wind and Jagh walks the webs in spider form, sensing the vibrations of the goblins as they jump from web to web. With new webs constantly being spun, and old ones disintegrating or breaking, the Silken Paths are difficult to navigate, and after a few minutes of being led about, the druid and mystic find themselves back where they started. Just after the heroes reunite as Vesper returns to the ledge with Yzak and Zap, the two goblins slide down from a web strand opposite the cliff, taking a foolhardy and brave leap as they vault across the void, landing with a somersault. The shorter goblin introduces himself as Yuk Yuk, and his companion as Spiderbait. Yuk Yuk does all the talking, saying the heroes will never find their way through the Silken Paths by themselves, and they'll need a guide who knows the Paths to find what they seek. Yuk Yuk negotiates as Spiderbait dumbly nods, at first asking for Zap's magic dagger as his payment, then for the first pick of any loot they find in their passage, before finally agreeing to take one share of the treasure for the Web Runners to split. The goblins each produce a gourd filled with grease, oiling up their feet to "surf the webs." Having forged a compact, the heroes prepare to follow the goblins through the Silken Paths to find the Lost Tomb of Khaem.<br>

<p>Day 28 – Alturiak 16 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
"<span class="caps">SPIDERBAIT</span>"&nbsp;<br>
As the Web Runners grease up their feet to prepare to cross the spider silk, Yuk Yuk says that he can get the party anywhere in the Paths; he just needs to know where. Gazing at Yzak's birthmark map, he says that he thinks he knows the place, and tells Spiderbait to get in front as the heroes insist that the goblins take point. Zimmerl asks how Spiderbait got his name, to which Yuk Yuk replies that Spiderbait doesn't speak anything but Goblin, so he just calls him that to others. Zimmerl telepathically contacts "Spiderbait", who is surprised at the contact, and reveals his real name to be Zug Zug.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ETTERCAP</span> <span class="caps">ATTACK</span><br>
With Zug Zug/Spiderbait leading the way, the party is bumbling along the narrow, wobbly spiderwebs toward their goal when a trio of ettercaps – humanoid spiders which shepherd natural spiders, transforming the wilds that they infest into gloomy places choked with webs and infested with arachnids. One ettercap dangles from a thick rope of web just above the party's head level, alerting Zap to their presence thanks to the choked gags of Prince Derendil, whom the ettercap assails with a web garrote. Zap, too, is assaulted, and Spiderbait quickly falls before their assault. Each blow landed in the Silken Paths threatens further injury, as ettercaps and heroes alike lose their balance and fall into the five hundred foot void, only to have their fall broken by one of the many strands crisscrossing the gap. The ettercaps' poisonous bites and entangling webs add to the Paths' own difficult nature, but with Yzak mounted on Vesper and Zimmerl upon Hor'lothchath, the heroes have an advantage in their aerial escort, and are able to vanquish the quiet killers. Zimmerl heals the fallen Zug Zug, who earnestly thanks the drow for saving his life.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">MAD</span> <span class="caps">SPECTATOR</span>&nbsp;<br>
Yuk Yuk dusting off Spiderbait's shoulder, the goblins remain in front despite having demonstrated their fragility. As the party pushes onward, their minds are contacted by an unseen voice, which warns them of "demons rising in the dark", and proceeds to become increasingly paranoid as the heroes display intimate knowledge of the demonic incursion in the Underdark. Accusing the heroes of being demons themselves, come to bind it into servitude, the creature attacks, revealing itself to be a spectator, the lesser beholderkin encountered before by the party in the service of the Demogorgon cult in the Whorlstone Tunnels. Blasting Spider-Jagh with its paralysis and fear rays, the spectator is too confident in its flight for its defense, and is quickly incapacitated by a Hideous Laughter spell from Zap followed by Yzak leaping upon it to deliver the coup de grace. The kobold beastmaster leaps from the sinking beholder's body after it is slain onto his bat companion, having severed a pair of its eyestalks for some later use.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HALFLING</span> <span class="caps">BURGLAR</span>&nbsp;<br>
Pressing forward, Spider-Jagh senses vibration on the web strand they are traversing, and believes that something is struggling in the webbing ahead. As it comes in the range of his superior darkvision, Zimmerl mentally contacts the being cocooned in webbing, demanding to know its race. The fearful humanoid reveals himself to be Fargas Rumblefoot, a lightfoot halfling rogue from the surface world. Zap cuts Fargas free, revealing his pale, desiccated form. After some healing from Jagh (and after getting over seeing this bizarre menagerie of adventurers when Zimmerl casts Dancing Lights so Fargas can see), Fargas explains that he was part of an adventuring company seeking the Lost Tomb of Khaem, and that his companions were butchered by a band of ravening gnolls. Fargas was hired on for his scouting abilities and expertise with traps, and claims ignorance on just what exactly might be within the tomb besides the sword Dawnbringer (though he says his party wizard described it as part of a Netherese floating palace which punched through the earth when the Netheril Empire literally fell), but offers to guide the party there in exchange for a share of the treasure. Yuk Yuk, having none of this, tells Fargas that the Web Runners are the contracted guides for this lost party, and besides, Fargas's party leader probably didn't trust "the thief" with any more operational intelligence than strictly necessary. Fargas retorts that, in fact, he has a map – one that the dwarf in his party cut from a kobold's birthmarked body a century or so ago. As he produces this map, which is on black kobold scales much like Yzak's own before he became white-scaled in the Whorlstone Tunnels, Yzak keeps silent that this is likely from one of his kin. Fargas also says that his party wizard described the entrance as a narrow side passage leading to a dirty marble wall with a bronze-encased door set deep within it, green with age. Yuk Yuk says that he knows the place! And thus armed with Fargas's lore and Yuk Yuk's knowledge of the area, the two combative guides lead the party to their shared goal.<br>

<p><span class="caps">AGGRESSIVE</span> <span class="caps">NEGOTIATIONS</span>&nbsp;<br>
On the way through the Silken Paths, Zimmerl spots a pair of drow, the leader bearing the sigil of House Do'Urden of Menzoberranzan, attended by their four quaggoth slaves as they travel in the opposite direction down another web strand. Zimmerl knows that House Do'Urden was destroyed some time ago, but that it has recently been resurrected as a puppet house by House Baenre, the wicked rulers of the City of Spiders. Borne upon the red wyrmling Hor'lothchath, Zimmerl flies over to his fellow drow and addresses the leader, demanding his business. With Zimmerl claiming membership of a senior house which left Menzoberranzan to pursue colonial interests, and of course riding a dragon, the hapless noble has little option but to submit to his whims. Zimmerl tells him to abandon his mission to Gracklstugh in light of Themberchaud's conquest there, and instead to report to Menzoberranzan on the presence of Zuggtmoy in Neverlight Grove. As Zimmerl returns to the group and the Do'Urden party passes by, Prince Derendil rails against fate, lamenting that he should allow those who share his form to pass by, chained by the corrupted dark elves, when they should rise up against their hateful masters. Zimmerl chastises Derendil, reminding him that he is a prince and a true elf. Derendil, brooding, submits to Zimmerl for now. However, after the two groups pass each other by, Zap flies on Vesper's back after the drow, using Mage Hand to steal a vial of sleep poison off the party leader. The drow see the svirfneblin's thievery and start to chase him down, but Zap flies through the spiderwebbed chasm, quickly losing his marks in the crisscrossing paths.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HORRID</span> <span class="caps">SOUNDS</span><br>
In the last leg of the walk to the Lost Tomb, the party's travel is plagued by terrible shrieks, moans, and incoherent gibbering that echoes through nearby passages. Despite a thorough search, as far as the heroes can tell, these sounds have no apparent origin. Jagh is driven mad by the experience, believing himself to have no personality of his own, but to absorb the identity of whatever he consumes. As the druid feasts upon ripplebark fungus and becomes obstinately unresponsive, sitting down on the web strand in the belief that he is a mushroom, the flumph Jigglycloud diagnoses him with a case of The Madness of Juiblex. The Faceless Lord Juiblex, a.k.a. the Oozing Hunger, seems to be yet another demon prince with influence in the Underdark as well.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">VOICE</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DARK</span>&nbsp;<br>
The Web Runners take the group down a side passage with a marble wall along one side, which Fargas Rumblefoot proclaims to exactly match his old party's wizard's description. As the motley crew nears the passage, a soft feminine voice sounds out in their minds, faintly and distantly pleading for help, asking to be set free after having been trapped in the dark "for so long." There is no response to either vocal or mental replies, and even Jigglycloud's advanced telepathy gains little more than an impression of the direction to the entrance of the tomb.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GAINING</span> <span class="caps">ENTRY</span> TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TOMB</span><br>
Yzak and Vesper pair up to push open the heavy door to the tomb, it being a massive disc of stone encased in bronze, pivoting on a central hinge. Fargas and Zap scout the entrance room, finding a stone diorama depicting the half-elven sorceress Brysis of Khaem as a Netherese noble in her prime, surrounded by attendants, slaves, and other trappings of wealth and power. A vista of fantastic floating cities covers an entire wall.</p>
<p>Descending a staircase some ten stories, passing by a Netherese calendar stone on the first landing, Zap and Fargas scout ahead to find a shrine at the bottom of the stairs. Here lie shreds of dusty tapestries scattered upon the floor, and the friezes on the walls are defaced with deep gouges. The rogues determine that the damage is relatively recent, and that the creatures that caused it left no tracks of any kind on the dusty floor.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">FALSE</span> <span class="caps">TOMB</span>&nbsp;<br>
Taking one of the doors from the shrine, the heroes find a room containing a wide stone sarcophagus atop a black marble bier, as well as a dozen niches along the wall housing clay canopic jars, each containing desiccated organs. After Zap finds no traps, Jagh goes to lift the sarcophagus lid, which looks incredibly heavy but is heaved with ease by the half-orc. Within, he finds a life-sized statue of the sorceress Brysis, sculpted and painted to look like she is sleeping comfortably. As he pushes the lid aside, he and all the other hear a booming voice that calls out: "<span class="caps">THOU</span> <span class="caps">HAST</span> <span class="caps">DISTURBED</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TOMB</span> OF <span class="caps">BRYSIS</span> OF <span class="caps">KHAEM</span>! <span class="caps">ACCURSED</span> <span class="caps">ART</span> <span class="caps">THOU</span>, YE <span class="caps">MOST</span> <span class="caps">MISERABLE</span> OF <span class="caps">CREATURES</span>!"

<p>In which the party battles the wraith of Brysis of Khaem; Yzak and Fargas's destinies collide as the heroes find Dawnbringer. Jagh experiments with wild magic.</p>
<p>Day 28 – Alturiak 16 (cont.)<br>
<span class="caps">DWELLERS</span> IN <span class="caps">DARKNESS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Weakened by the curse lingering in the false tomb, Fargas and the heroes make their way to a chamber with four sarcophagi, each bearing the sculpted image of a robed human. As Yzak takes the time to vandalize one grave with a mustache graffito, specters arise from each of the sarcophagi, howling in fury. Thanks to the party's deep knowledge of lore, they know specters are the angry, unfettered spirits of those who have been prevented from passing into the afterlife. Condemned to eternal damnation, these souls beyond redemption bring their undying hatred to bear on the heroes, draining their very life force even as a poltergeist – a confused, invisible spirit with no sense of how they died – hurls objects around the room.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883992/Spectre.PNG?1532723824"><br>
<br>
As the battle progresses, the extent of the faerzress infusing the tomb becomes apparent, as each spell cast triggers a wild magic surge – perhaps due to being the resting place of an ancient Netherese sorceress. In giant constrictor snake form, Jagh dominates the room despite being unable to grapple the incorporeal undead. The specters' lonely existence is soon ended, finding no rest or redemption but only the final oblivion that comes with the destruction of their souls.</p>
<p>After destroying the specters, Yzak and Zap scour the room, finding the funereal treasures of the specters as they were in life – the four most loyal and honored servants of Brysis of Khaem. After plundering the Netherese tomb, the heroes are about to turn to look elsewhere when they hear a faint, feminine telepathic voice cry out "Please, don't leave! I'm here, below!". After a quick search, they find one sarcophagus is on hidden rollers, and that sliding it aside reveals a hole leading to a different room.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TRUE</span> <span class="caps">TOMB</span><br>
Jagh, shifting from bear form to fit, squeezes through the hole in the floor, leaping down to the darkened room below. Exploring this forlorn place, he finds a room richly decorated in murals set with rich pigments and inlays of semiprecious stones, not seen by mortal eyes in centuries. There is a gilded sarcophagus atop a stone bier, from which rises not another specter, but a wraith.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883993/Wraith.PNG?1532723920"></p>
<p>As Jagh is the only hero in the true tomb of Brysis, the sorceress's wraith attacks, gloating how the heroes' deaths will free her from this prison, and how her victims will serve her even in death. Wraiths are malice incarnate, a malevolent void whose only purpose is to annihilate life, and almost nothing exists of its former existence as Brysis of Khaem. As the heroes leap down one at a time to engage this soulless wraith, Fargas joins them, taunting the body-bereft being to "give him the sword so he can be on his way." Taking affront to this claim on his weapon of destiny, Yzak shoots the halfling with his dual crossbows, pretending to be aiming for the formless wraith. The beastmaster's companion is less subtle, Vesper flying in to deliver a vicious bite to Fargas after his master's lead. As the halfling is down, Brysis's wraith reaches a formless hand into his chest and stops his heart. An instant later, Fargas's spirit rises as a specter, the latest thrall of this undead commander.</p>
<p>As the melee rages, the telepathic voice calls out to the heroes once again, saying "In the sarcophagus! I can help you!". Vesper lifts the gold-filigreed lid, revealing Brysis's withered and mummified corpse. On her chest, grasped in both hands, lies a golden hilt. Prying it from the corpse's fingers, Yzak lifts the hilt – and as he does so a blade of pure radiance ignites from its base, filling the room with brilliant light. This is Dawnbringer, a sentient sun blade long left abandoned in the Underdark.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883995/Dawnbringer.PNG?1532723967"><br>
<br>
Wielding this holy weapon, Yzak strikes the fatal blow to Brysis's wraith, ending her curse on the party. Although Zimmerl knows he can raise Fargas now that the wraith no longer is blocking his path to the afterlife, the halfling's specter is destroyed as well, condemning him to utter nonexistence as his soul is obliterated.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DENOUEMENT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Jagh, now in giant constrictor snake form, searches around the room and happens upon an invisible stone chest at the foot of Brysis's sarcophagus, finding a great deal of coinage, as well as a Necklace of Fireballs and a Philter of Love. After splitting the loot (without Fargas's share to consider), the heroes return to their followers at the mouth of the tomb. Jimjar asks where Fargas ended up, to which Yzak replies they had to part ways since he was "a tomb robber." Jimjar says that, though as a gnome he has never uttered these words before, for a kobold Yzak is alright.</p>
<p>The group decides to rest the day away, healing up after the Silken Paths and the Lost Tomb. As they do, Yzak takes the opportunity to experiment with the wild magic present. After finding many results, the ranger finds one possible outcome of spellcasting here is the possibility for reincarnation. Contemplating suicide in order to achieve some greater form, Yzak decides not to follow through.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FEY</span> <span class="caps">PALAVER</span><br>
The half-orc druid Jagh, however, is intrigued. Casting dozens of spells in seclusion lest he harm his fellow party-members (though he manages to turn a cave lizard invisible, cause it to fly, become afraid of it, and then target it with lethal electrical shocks), Jagh eventually attracts the attention of two separate fey creatures – the unicorns Snapdragon and Snowhoof, whom he inadvertently conjures to this subterranean tomb. Snapdragon claims part of the High Forest in the surface world (above Araumycos) as his domain, and Snowhoof yet resides in the Feywild plane along with Titania the Faerie Queen.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883997/Unicorn.PNG?1532724237"><br>
<br>
The unicorns take Jagh's ominous tales of Zuggtmoy's impending nuptials with Araumycos very seriously, since not even the gods will speak of Araumycos, and if the Demon Queen of Fungi is allowed to unite with the fungal realm, her power will become nearly peerless on the Material Plane. In the process, Jagh is subjected to wild magic that does more than just create a feather beard that he sneezes off as Zap did – though he does that as well. Jagh grows 8 inches in height, loses all his hair, grows 8 inches in height, and even becomes 10 years younger, appearing a mere 12 years old to other eyes. He twice visits the Astral Plane as well, seeing an astral dreadnought hunt him down, and in a vision of an alternate future, sees the monster cut him in half with its pincers.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/883996/Astral_Dreadnought.jpg?1532724197"></p>
<p><span class="caps">METAMORPHOSIS</span>&nbsp;<br>
For all intents, Jagh is now a new man. And yet the druid is not yet done exploring the possibilities of wild magic. Eventually, he knows that he will be instantly reincarnated if is dies in the immediate future. Perhaps feeling the wheel of life turning, Jagh steps outside the tomb, informs his companions that nothing is wrong, and proceeds to leap off the cliff into the chasm of the Silken Paths. Hurtling past many strands of spiderwebs, the half-orc plummets to the cavern floor 500 feet below, impaling himself on a stalagmite and perishing. Jimjar had been Yzak 20 gold that Jagh would not return. Moments later, Jagh's flesh is magically stitched back together in unexpected ways. His soul briefly visits the Fugue Plane, where the death god Kelemvor judges his soul unready for its eternal promise, sending him back. Jagh returns to his mortal form to find it more lithe and angular than he left it – he runs his hands over his face, finding no tusks but only delicate features and pointed ears. Judging by the coppery hue of his skin and his dark hair, he has been reincarnated by the vagueries of wild magic to become a wood elf. Faintly in his head, Jagh hears the voice of the Leaflord, Rillifane Rallathil, god of the wood elves, who tells him that if he is now a wood elf he shall fight as one, and that Rillifane has need of priests in the world to pursue his divine agenda.</p>

<p>In which arachnoid outcasts of dark elf society ambush the heroes as they leave the Silken Paths after plundering the Lost Tomb of Khaem.<br>
<br>
Day 28 – Alturiak 16 (cont.)<br>
<span class="caps">DWELLERS</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DEMONWEBS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Thanks to his trusty Sentinel Shield, the presence of the wary Web Runners Yuk Yuk and Spiderbait, and his own keen elven senses, Zimmerl Oblodra is extremely difficult to take unawares. As the party and their followers extract themselves from the Silken Webs, now armed with Yzak's sentient sunblade Dawnbringer, the drow mystic senses a drider (a horrid hybrid of a drow with the lower body of a giant spider, created when a promising drow fails the Test of Lolth, and which now wander the Underdark as mad hunters) creeping up on the heroes' company, clambering along the cavern wall just out of bow-shot.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884084/Drider.PNG?1532756855"><br>
<br>
Zimmerl&nbsp;also senses several creatures lying in ambush among the web strands just above the party's heads: there are three chitines (four-armed twisted monstrosities created by cruel drow rituals upon surface elves, turned against their creators by Lolth when her people failed to devote their creations to the Queen of Spiders) and a choldrith (the more arachnid members of the chitines' race, which function as their commanders, priests, and supervisors).<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884085/Chitine.PNG?1532756955"></p>
<p><br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884086/Choldrith.PNG?1532756977"><br>
<br>
The drider (a fallen priestess of Lolth) and choldrith cast Hold Person, attempting to no avail to render the PCs easy prey to knock off the web strands into the waiting chasm below. The chitines charge forward, trusting in their spiderweb armor to protect them as they juggle daggers, stabbing at the heroes. The luckless goblin Spiderbait falls quickly to the onslaught, bleeding out as he is caught in the webbing. Another ambusher reveals itself, having evaded even Zimmerl's eyes – a cave fisher, which resembles a man-sized tailless scorpion with a long snout. The creature tries to snag Zap with the sticky filament extending from its snout to reel him up for dinner, but the deep gnome resists the pull. Meanwhile Jagh, in spider form himself, moves easily along the web strands, but finds his webbing less than useful offensively against the arachnid ambushers.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884087/Cave_Fisher.PNG?1532757009"></p>
<p>Mounted on Vesper, Yzak flies across the void to battle the drider face-to-face, igniting Dawnbringer's radiant blade to the dismayed hisses of the drider. Shade leaps and teleports through the shadows cast by the sun blade, joining in the onslaught. The heroes are nearly unable to pierce the drider's tough natural armor, but the cursed priestess is blinded by Dawnbringer's sunlight, and lands few sword blows on the heroes. After many misses, in frustration she swings her sword at the web strand that Shade is on, hoping to cut away the monk's footing, but his tabaxi reflexes let him catch a nearby strand and he does not fall to his doom. Meanwhile Zimmerl's psionic powers find their mark more easily than do physical blows, and by sheer mental overwhelming he is able to kill the drider, the last of the arachnid outcasts to remain alive.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SOCIETY</span> OF <span class="caps">BRILLIANCE</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the drider falls to oblivion, the heroes feel a warm, rejuvenating glow wash over them as positive energy heals their wounds – including the fallen Spiderbait. Looking up, they see an unlikely ally: a kuo-toa archpriest introduces himself as Sloopidoop of the Society of Brilliance, the same sect of intelligent, faerzress-investigating monsters to which Grazilaxx the mind flayer belonged, whom they encountered 17 days prior as they hunted the Darklake hag coven. Like Grazilaxx, Sloopidoop says that he remembers the party, having met them before, though they have yet to meet him.</p>

<p>In which a perilous path is chosen, and the heroes become what they face as they complete a beaten gnoll warband's hook horror hunt.</p>
<p>Day 28 – Alturiak 16 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">FUTURE</span>'S <span class="caps">PAST</span>&nbsp;<br>
The kuo-toa Sloopidoop is humbled and awed to meet the party, saying that the legends mention a band of heroes who helped Shuushar escape the clutches of the drow. In the future Faerûn which he is from, Shuushar the Awakened is a revered prophet of his people, whom he has led into a philosophy of peace; Sloopidoop is an archpriest of Shuushar's teachings. He has a sudden recollection and urgently warns the group that Zuggtmoy, the Lady of Decay, is in Neverlight Grove, and is dismayed that they have already been there – he must have miscalculated his time jump. When asked how he comes from the future, Sloopidoop explains that Grazilaxx, the illithid founder and leader of the Society of Brilliance, traveled to the Deep Ethereal Plane, where he discovered the Demiplane of Time and mastered its secrets, becoming a chronomancer. Grazilaxx now travels the timestream of Toril in order to better study the effects of faerzress upon the world, and has gathered a society of like-minded geniuses from different periods to aid him.</p>
<p>The goblin Web Runners seem to recognize Sloopidoop, Yuk Yuk piping up as the kuo-toa mentions studying the faerzress – the Web Runners had been hired to find any concentrations, and report that the Lost Tomb is riddled with the magical radiation. Before parting ways with the heroes, Sloopidoop offers his clerical magic for the party, who ask him to scry on Ilvara and her drow. The archpriest obliges, but the priestess of Lolth's phenomenal willpower dazes him as she spots and destroys his scrying sensor. With deepest apologies, Sloopidoop heads toward the Lost Tomb with Yuk Yuk and Spiderbait, asking that when they meet him in his own past, that they remind him that Demogorgon is in the Darklake.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LOWER</span> <span class="caps">PATH</span><br>
As the mystic Zimmerl meditates to restore his psionic power, Yzak and Zap mount Vesper and scout the Silken Paths for a route back toward the Darklake that would circumvent the demon-tainted Neverlight Grove. On the cavern floor, not far from where the three of them fought the mimic that morning, Yzak discovers a small passage headed east. As they fly toward it, Vesper suddenly bucks violently, trying to throw his master and Zap from his back. Yzak is able to soothe the savage bat's heart, but is shaken by his beast's disobedience.</p>
<p>Exploring the tunnel stealthily, the trio comes upon a pair of gnolls and their three hyenas, gnawing flesh off of bloody bones and cracking them open to suck the marrow. The heroes muse whether these are the same mad gnolls that the late&nbsp;Fargas Rumblefoot reported had slain his adventuring companions. Each gnoll has a pair of shortswords strapped to his side.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884094/Gnoll2.PNG?1532759353"><br>
<br>
Zap, using Mage Hand, surreptitiously moves one of the gnoll's swords to the other's belt, and follows this with a ghost sound of a yelp. Looking around in alarm, the gnolls go to draw their weapons, and leap for one another's throats when it appears one has stolen from the other. After the three-sworded gnoll bests his one-sworded comrade, the fallen gnoll immediately rises as a witherling, a sort of undead gnoll created when the beastmen turn against one another. There is an indecisive skirmish as the airborne heroes chase the pack through the tunnel and exchange arrows before Yzak turns Vesper back to the Silken Paths and the rest of the group.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884095/Gnoll3.PNG?1532759399"></p>
<p><span class="caps">HOOK</span> <span class="caps">HORROR</span> <span class="caps">HUNT</span>&nbsp;<br>
After descending to the cavern floor with their followers to follow this path, the party follows Yzak's lead as he tracks the gnolls. Soon, the heroes hear clacking and scraping noises as they approach a crossways corridor – suddenly, two hook horrors dash across the passage in front of the party, fearful and fleeing. Behind them, and headed in the heroes' direction, the group hears cackling and insane giggles. Zap pokes his head around to find four rampaging gnoll warriors. He backstabs the first gnoll to charge out the side passage, and the fully-recharged Zimmerl faces the remaining foes and slays them in a single blast.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884096/Hook_Horror.PNG?1532759434"></p>
<p>The sound of Zimmerl's attack echoes through the tunnel complex, alerting the rest of the gnoll warband, which howls in manic anticipation of combat. Careening toward the heroes to avenge their packmates, the gnolls attack in waves from two directions, goaded forward by their pack lord, who whips them into a blood frenzy, seeking sacrifices in the name of Yeenoghu, the demon lord of the hunt worshiped by their race. Perhaps it was this bestial fury that nearly overcame Vesper.</p>
<p>The savage gnolls are reckless fighters (all of them sporting weeping sores on their body) whipped into a frenzy by Yeenoghu, and though they individually fall quickly, the warriors, hunters, flesh-gnawers, and witherling combine their talents to whittle away at the heroes' defenses with each bite, arrow, and spear-thrust. The pack lord is a flind – an exceptionally strong and vicious gnoll who wields a flail imbued by Yeenoghu himself with powerful magic of disorientation, paralysis, and wracking pain. The flind growls prayers to his Abyssal prince in the demonic tongue, reading omens in blood splatters as he lays into Zimmerl, critically striking the drow despite his mystical Cloak of Air, knocking him out of the fight.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884098/Flind.PNG?1532759539"><br>
<br>
As the flind's blood thirst guides his warband toward weak prey ripe for the slaughter, their bloody jaws seem as though they might be the end. A timely arrival from Jagh – in allosaur form – knocks the flind to the ground, and after Zimmerl is healed he re-manifests Cloak of Air. The cruel flind tries again to kill Zimmerl, but this time the cloak's wind twists the flind's flail, striking its wielder. Focusing on the flind, the party redoubles their efforts to kill him, and Allosaur-Jagh bites the pack lord in half. The warband furiously tries to avenge their leader, but without his guiding bloodthirst their fierceness is much diluted, and soon the gnolls are beaten.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CORNERED</span><br>
After exploring the area, which turns out to be a hook horror lair where the gnoll warband harried the denizens, the heroes turn to the hook horrors' last redoubt. Zap goes ahead, but is (surprisingly) detected by the mated pair of hook horrors. The female deals him a vicious blow with her hook, prepared to fight to the death to defend their lair. Before withdrawing, the deep gnome spies a hole in the ceiling that begs further examination. Returning to the others outside the narrow passage, Zap has Zimmerl create a psionic sensor with a coin, which he then levitates with Mage Hand after a more stealthy return – and finds a nest of four trembling eggs.</p>
<p>After a heated debate in which the druid Jagh advocated for leaving the hunted monstrosities to their own fate, Yzak insisted upon gaining the eggs for his own use. Sneaking past the hook horrors, the beastmaster scales the cave wall and reaches the sandy nest, stealing one of the eggs from the clutch and running back toward the main tunnel. The enraged parents give chase just as Yzak planned, and the nimble kobold attacks the two monsters in the tight passage, keeping ahead of them and firing his crossbows or tumbling between their legs as he doubles back to keep the chase in the tight quarters which hinder their sweeping hook attacks. After a tactically and technically superb but ethically shaky battle, Yzak kills both hook horrors and reverts to the Chaotic Neutral kobold he was before encountering his current alternate self at the mysterious obelisk in the Whorlstone Tunnels – who until this moment had been Chaotic Good.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HOOK</span> <span class="caps">HORROR</span> <span class="caps">NEST</span>&nbsp;<br>
Gathering their followers into the nest for a secluded, defensible resting spot, the party takes a much-needed break. During the night, all four hook horror eggs hatch while next to Yzak, and each of the orphaned infant monsters imprints on the kobold as its loving parent.<br>
<br>

<p>Day 29 – Alturiak 17<br>
<span class="caps">CLIFF</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">LADDER</span><br>
During the next day's travel to the east, the party encounters a fifty-foot cliff, atop which they spy a rolled-up rope ladder. Yzak flies to the top and unfurls the ladder for the others to climb, rolling it back up to impede the progress of Ilvara and her pursuing drow.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CRYSTAL</span> <span class="caps">CLUSTERS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Near the end of a peril-less but exhausting day's travel through the Underdark, as the group is thinking of setting up camp when they find a dozen fist-sized chunks of quartz that glow dimly, infused with faerzress. After Jimjar bets Yzak that he won't throw one down at his own feet, Yzak discovers that a sharp impact will break the crystals open in a burst of blinding light. Taking the time to harvest the crystals no doubt allows the drow to close the distance between them somewhat, but the party feels safe having slowed them at the cliff, and falls once more into uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>Day 30 – Alturiak 18&nbsp;<br>

After another day's travel, the party comes upon the hidden grotto on the shores of the Darklake where they had stashed their stolen keelboat flotilla, marked by a secret Druidic rune left by Jagh. Jagh is surprised to notice other Druidic markings left next to his – the personal sigil of Balnur Berrybrewer, a dwarf druid he was acquainted with as a fellow member of the surface world druidical hierarchy. Going down into the grotto, the party finds Balnur sitting quietly on one of their keelboats.</p>
<p>When asked what in the Nine Hells he is doing in the Underdark, Balnur replies that he is "the strongest, fastest, smartest, and most beautiful person that he knows," and so has taken it upon himself to look into the dangers to the natural world in the Underdark here. Jagh notes that Balnur's demeanor seems overly intense, but for now Berrybrewer joins their company.</p>

<p>In which the treacherous Darklake is traversed a third time, encountering yet more bizarre and fearsome fauna and raging demons.</p>
<p>Day 30 – Alturiak 18 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BERRYBREWER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Jagh and the others interrogate the dwarf druid Balnur Berrybrewer, quickly diagnosing him with some unknown mental malady. Balnur says he came down from the overworld not so long ago by way of a passage to the surface at Mantol-Derith, just north of the Darklake. Not overly confident of the dwarf's ability to navigate back to the hidden trading post (which he describes as an unfriendly place, though in a secretive and suspicious way rather than overt hostility), they plot a course for Blingdenstone as planned.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FLAIL</span> <span class="caps">SNAIL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Before shoving off from their hidden grotto, the heroes are surprised when a large snail with mace-like appendages and a shimmering shell emerges from the inky Darklake. After some hemming and hawing about whether to attack the elemental creature after it defensively flashes blinding light, Zimmerl uses his drow magic to cast Faerie Fire on it, revealing its shell's spell-reflecting nature. Heedless, Balnur casts Thunderwave, which is reflecting back upon him and knocks him off the keelboat thrashing into the drink. A second spell from the dwarf, Entangle, manages to get past the snail's defenses. Zap's quick blades are able to cut off a couple of the snail's flails, evoking wails of pain.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">TOUCHED</span> BY <span class="caps">BLIPDOOLPOOLP</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the creature huddles inside its shell and Yzak ponders how to boil it, a more dire threat is summoned by its loud cries: a twenty foot tall fish-man, recognized by Jagh as a kuo-toa leviathan, stands from the water with a huge splash. These giant mutants have been blessed by their race's scavenger goddess, Blipdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, with monstrous size and the reverence of their kin.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884104/Kuo-Toa_Leviathan.PNG?1532760791"><br>
<br>
Having divested himself of the Darklake, Balnur (endowed with Barkskin and a Shillelagh) charges in to join battle. The leviathan displays his immense strength as he grabs Vesper and Jagh, clasping one in each clawed hand. But soon Jagh, in giant serpent form, grapples back, and Zap's trusty Tasha's Hideous Laughter incapacitates the monster. Its massive, inert form becomes an easy target for the adventurers as they attack with impunity, slaying Blipdoolpoolp's servant. In the aftermath, Yzak harvest's the flail snail's valuable shell, planning to have it crafted into spell-proof armor. Finding the glassy snail-trail left by the creature, the ranger goes on to crack and harvest some of the substance, then to have Har'lothchath melt it down and Maguff help him spin it into lens shape, using Octopus-Jagh's ink to darken it so the kobold can wield the sun blade Dawnbringer without blinding penalty. Yzak harvests the kuo-toa's ten tons of fishy bulk for what meat he can carry.</p>
<p>Day 31 – Alturiak 19&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">CHASME</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">SHADOW</span> <span class="caps">DEMONS</span>&nbsp;<br>
In the "daytime", the party comes to a powerful whirlpool that presents a challenging boating obstacle. Zimmerl creates a wall of psychic force that blunts the maelstrom's effects, easing the keelboats' passage.</p>
<p>In the evening, the party halts their voyage for a time to take a badly-needed rest at a rocky shore. As they set down their bedrolls, they see a drow sign indicating the presence of demons. It is the third watch they set – the dark elf Zimmerl and the newly-made wood elf Jagh – who hear a distant buzzing noise echoing across the Darklake. As they decide whether to investigate or to first awaken their fellows, three shadow shapes emerge from the ground at their feet, slashing at them with spectral claws which invoke not mere pain of the flesh, but a psychic rending as the shadow demons taste their doubts and fears.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884105/Shadow_Demon.PNG?1532760971"></p>
<p>As the other heroes rouse themselves, the source of the buzzing reveals itself not as a swarm of stirges as they had suspected, but as a chasme, an unspeakable demon hybrid of humanoid and fly whose loathsome droning sound inflicts the heroes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to the shadow demons' insubstantial claws. The chasme gives in to its demonic impulsiveness, dive-bombing Zimmerl with its wicked proboscis, only to have its devastating attack turned on itself by the mystic's Cloak of Air. With the chasme's horrid droning ceased, the party focuses on the shadow demons, which shrink before the intense sunlight shed by Dawnbringer. The sun blade's radiance burns these demons as though it were pure flame as it overpowers their very souls with positive energy, and the ranger is able to cut down his fiendish foes with alacrity – his own kobold eyes are shielded by his freshly-forged darkened lenses.</p>
<p>Day 32 – Alturiak 20<br>
Smooth sailing as the keelboats row east, their crew alternating watches to stay fresh.</p>
<p>Day 33 – Alturiak 21&nbsp;<br>
Around midday, the heroes' pull their keelboats ashore as Yzak reckons they are due south of the svirfneblin settlement of Blingdenstone, Zap's home, where they plan to meet the telepathic ooze Glabagool regarding someone called the Pudding King, in the hopes of gaining some&nbsp;weapon against the Lady of Decay, Zuggtmoy.</p>

<p>Day 33 – Alturiak 21 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PILLARS</span> OF <span class="caps">WOE</span>&nbsp;<br>
After half a day's march north from the Darklake shore toward Blingdenstone, the party comes to a vast cavern with a ceiling hundreds of feet high, featuring natural pillars stretching all the way to the top. The drow Zimmerl recognizes this as the Pillars of Woe, where his people's Army of the Black Spider was dealt a crushing defeat 115 years prior, during the Silence of Lolth, by Deepking Horgar IV of Gracklstugh when the drow of House Agrach Dyrr turned on their fellows. Horgar IV went on to lay siege to Menzoberranzan, where he was murdered by an assassin's blade before he could seize the drow city, putting Horgar V on the throne that he maintains to this day…unless Clan Steelshadow's dynasty has been cut short by the wrath of Themberchaud the Wyrmsmith. In the meantime, Horgar IV's artisans constructed a mausoleum for the noble duergar knights who perished on the field, while slaves dug a mass grave for the drow and the slaves from both hosts that died in this subterranean clash. Zimmerl spots the mausoleum, noting the broken crossbow bolt on a shield that serves as Laduguer the Exile's holy symbol, and further notices that the mausoleum's great stone door is slightly ajar. Yzak quickly finds a pair of humanoid footprints leading toward it.</p>
<p>"<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FLAWED</span> <span class="caps">WHO</span> <span class="caps">AREN</span>'T TO BE <span class="caps">TRUSTED</span>"<br>
Zap, Yzak and Vesper scout ahead into the crypt, observing a gruff duergar knight in blackened armor ask "Are you sure this is the right place, Dorthis?" in Dwarvish. A symbol<br>
is inscribed in white on his shield and breastplate, depicting a mace topped with a human skull – which Zap recognizes as that of Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath. A female duergar stands behind him next to an open sarcophagus, wearing a black robe bearing the same mace symbol, and carving something in an ancient corpse's withered chest with her dagger. "Yes, Ivar, grandfather's diary was quite clear; I'm almost done!" Both are marked with the facial tattoos of callassabraks, "the flawed who aren't to be trusted", outcast from duergar society.</p>
<p>Zap casts Mage Hand, stealing the open memoir from atop the sarcophagus. Yzak, who can read Dwarvish, quickly thumbs through it and finds it to be the diary of one Thangardt, a secret Orcus-worshiper who had fled across Faerûn to Gracklstugh from the Galena Mountains after the duergar Orcus cult there had been smashed when Gareth Dragonsbane, the paladin-king of Damara, stole the Wand of Orcus in the Bloodstone Wars some 130 years ago. Zap's arcane theories posit that these two, apparently Thangardt's grandchildren, have come here in the knowledge that they can carve Orcus's mace symbol over their grandfather's dusty heart to create a bodak – an unhallowed undead which pours its ravaged soul out in a withering death gaze, bringing annihilation to all who do not follow the Prince of Undeath. Yzak mentions the possibility of allying with the Orcus worshipers against Demogorgon's followers, and is intrigued by the possibility of communicating with Orcus, as the demon lord can recall anything a bodak sees or hears.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884111/Bodak.PNG?1532762929"></p>
<p>Rather than allow this to be, at the last moment Zap casts an illusion over Thangardt's corpse, obfuscating his heart and confusing his necromancer granddaughter Dorthis's efforts to carve Orcus's profane symbol into his chest. As Dorthis tries again, Yzak and Vesper charge her blackguard brother Ivar, the ranger igniting Dawnbringer and blinding the duergar as his own eyes are shielded by his darkened lenses. Zap stabs Dorthis deeply, but before she is laid low by Zimmerl's brute force mental blast, the Orcus cultist casts Blight, sapping vitality and moisture from Zap in a nearly-lethal counterattack. The heavily-armored Ivar proves more difficult to kill, brushing aside Serpent-Jagh's crushing coils, but his smiting mace rarely finds its target as he is blinded by Dawnbringer. Soon, he too lies dead on the ground, stabbed by Zap.</p>
<p>Further reading of the late Tharngardt's writings find they end with an addendum from his svirfneblin slave-scribe on how Thangardt perished on campaign at the Pillars of Woe; the slave returned to Gracklstugh before the army's<br>
defeat at Menzoberranzan. Zap produces the Stonespeaker Crystal gifted to them by Hgraam of Clan Cairngorm, using it to speak with the dead Dorthis. Asking questions drawn up by Yzak, he finds that the siblings have not been to any settlement other than Mantol-Derith since being exiled from Gracklstugh, and so know nothing of any developments in Blingdenstone or elsewhere – but she does mention that some of the nearby threats to the traveling group could include "friendly rats."</p>
<p><span class="caps">EVIL</span> <span class="caps">COLLECTIVE</span>&nbsp;<br>
About this time, Zimmerl notices a faint bluish glow approaching the tomb's doorway. Investigating, he finds a swarm of dozens of rats before him (with exposed, glowing brains!), which all stand and look at him with hypnotic eyes – but his mystical training throws off their enchanting domination and Zimmerl counters with a blast of pure force.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884110/CraniumRats.PNG?1532762889"><br>
<br>
Yzak and Zap fly out on Vesper to aid their companion, the ranger sweeping Dawnbringer through their number and devastating the swarm as no mundane weapon could do. As the beastmaster sends his newborn hook horrors to hunt down the surviving telepathic vermin, which Zimmerl and Yzak know to be frequent spies for mind flayers, Zap grants Zimmerl the Stonespeaker Crystal to use Speak With Dead on one of the rats. The illithid-trained Zimmerl asks the dead beast its origins, learning that it was a normal rat bombarded with psionic energy by an illithid named Zellix, the administrator of a subterranean insane asylum located between Menzoberranzan and Araj, the Tower of Vengeance. The rat says, too, that this is a secret, and that its duergar companions believed it to be an agent of the elder brain of an illithid city called Cyrog, where it says Zellix was outcast from. After a brief rest, the party moves northward.</p>
<p>Day 34 – Alturiak 22&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">UPPERDARK</span>&nbsp;<br>
The group notices that they have been walking steadily upward as they are en route toward Blingdenstone – the transition from Middledark to Upperdark is marked. Food becomes more common, with plentiful game (rats, lizards, and giant vermin) and water trickling from the surface to nourish fungi. Luminescent flora is widespread here, with relatively many areas of dim light, and air quality increases as they near vents toward the surface.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LAVA</span> <span class="caps">SWELL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Midday, the heroes are reminded that the environment is still alien and hostile as they are going up a steep grade in a long and winding corridor when a tremor opens up a lava-filled fissure before them, pouring molten rock down at them. Their burns are quickly healed, chipping away at their reserves. Jimjar notes that Ilvara is likely to be thrown off their trail a bit by this phenomenon, and the group stops to allow the red wyrmling Hor'lothchath a few minutes to wallow in the lava.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GAS</span> <span class="caps">LEAK</span>&nbsp;<br>
Coming to a stop that night, the party sets up camp and appoints a watch as usual – but it isn't until the second watch, when Jagh is joining Zimmerl, that the druid notes to the mystic (who no longer breathes) that there is a strong odor of natural gas. There is some talk of circumventing the entire cavern by adding half a day's journey, or of pushing through and hoping to survive the poisonous (and combustible!) vapors, but very quickly Zimmerl's idea to have Hor'lothchath explode the cavern finds favor. The heroes and their followers break camp, backtracking out of the cavern and taking cover as the dragon expels its flame breath, detonating the entire cavern as Zimmerl's telekinetic barrier&nbsp;contains the blast, leaving a small hole open on Jimjar's advice to release pressure lest the blast cause the roof to cave in. Lowering the shield after a gout of flame and a thundering boom come through it (Jagh wary of predators or worse that might be attracted by the sound), the heroes step through to find Hor'lothchath frolicking in the air amid the falling cinders of moss, as charred bat skeletons clatter to the stone floor.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CREEPER</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ABYSS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Passing through the blasted chamber to find a more suitable campground, the heroes are confronted by a huge demonic spider with a body the size of a plow horse – and its legs stretching to some 14 feet. Zap and Zimmerl recognize this as a bebilith – a demon to be sure, but not a member of the dominant tanar'ri Abyssal race, these fiends most enjoy hunting other demons. Some say they do this as some sort of ancient punishment, others out of pure love of cruelty or unstoppable hunger. Whatever the case, the extremely aggressive bebiliths will pursue and devour whatever they can catch and overpower, as occurred 116 years ago when the vengeful drow of Menzoberranzan summoned dozens of these demons, which proceeded to slaughter some 9,000 deep gnomes in the Fall of Blingdenstone. Anyone slain by the bebilith's fiendish bite is disintegrated as they are burst into flames from within by its evil poison. This may be the mightiest foe yet to cross the party's path.</p>

<p>Day 34 – Alturiak 22 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">BARBED</span> <span class="caps">HORROR</span>&nbsp;<br>
The huge, murderous demonic arachnoid called a bebilith bears down on the party as they leave the ash and embers of the gas explosion, falling upon Yzak first. Yzak throws several of the faerzress-infused quartz crystals at the monster, but is unable to blind it. The fiend-foe is able to fend off the worst of the Abyssal monster's onslaught thanks to his recent fighter training, and it does not break his armor, but its vicious poisonous bite turns his blood to flame for a moment and the ranger is wracked with agony. Yzak takes to the air on Vesper's back, joining Zimmerl, who has mystically taken a wind form to avoid the cruel barbs of the demon's claws. This leaves Zap, who has been spell-sniping from behind a stalagmite, to confront the horror on the ground.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884112/bebilith.jpg?1532763464"><br>
<br>
The rogue proves his worth with a devastating sneak attack, which Zimmerl follows up on by telekinetically grasping the bebilith from above, moving it past Zap for a free cheap shot. Zap's backstabs and Zimmerl's psionic hold provide the engine of the demon's destruction, and soon the thing is sent by Zap back to the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, leaving only a hellish slime, and the party is able to sleep in peace.</p>
<p>Day 35 – Alturiak 23&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">ROCKFALL</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">ROCKTOPUS</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the party trudges ever upward through the Upperdark, there is a tremor that causes a rockslide as they pass through a long and winding passage. As the pebbles and boulders tumble downward toward them, none of the party suffers deadly injuries, but Zimmerl is grasped by an unexpected tentacle – there is a giant "rocktopus" that has adapted to life on land, lying in wait for prey, which has been revealed and disturbed by the avalanche. Zimmerl counterattacks, giving the beast a mild psychic wound, but the ranger Yzak is able to soothe the savage beast, taming the rocktopus and coaxing it to follow them with a steady stream of kuo-toa leviathan flesh. He hopes that Jagh will give the animal some training and care once the druid emerges from torpor.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SHELTER</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DARK</span><br>
That night, the company comes to an unexpected shelter – an easily defensible cave, unoccupied by any beast or bandit. Here, they sleep soundly in the sure and certain knowledge they will go unmolested through the night.</p>
<p>Day 36 – Alturiak 24<br>
<span class="caps">GNOMISH</span> <span class="caps">TRINKETS</span>&nbsp;<br>
After an arduous day's climb through the Upperdark, the group happens upon what appears to be the ruins of a tiny gnomish outpost which once allowed agents of Blingdenstone to survey enemy traffic and trade. Before setting up camp, Zap, Zimmerl, and Yzak come across several gnomish trinkets.&nbsp;<br>
1.) A tiny music box that Zap activates, as usual, from behind cover while casting Mage Hand from ten yards away. When he triggers its mechanism, it softly tinkles out a song that he dimly remembers from his childhood in Blingdenstone.&nbsp;<br>
2.) A glass orb filled with water, in which swims a mechanical goldfish. Or perhaps it is not water, but alcohol.&nbsp;<br>
3.) A tiny mechanical crab that moves about when unobserved. There is much interest in this item – Zap thoroughly hides himself and stares at it while Zimmerl turns his back to it, Yzak looks at it from around a corner with the hag-preserved derro head and with a mirror, etc. Eventually it is determined that it will not move while any form of vision is cast upon it, and Yzak pronounces it profoundly valuable since they can now definitively tell if they are being scryed upon.&nbsp;<br>
4.) A document written in Gnomish: the deed to "Plowfuddle", a small estate in Blingdenstone, signed by King Schnicktick and dated 1356 (current year 1487). The previous owner no doubt was a gentleman of Blingdenstone who was caught here when this outpost fell, perhaps when the drow of Menzoberranzan assaulted Blingdenstone in 1371. The party resolves to occupy this abandoned(?) manor.</p>
<p>While the fellowship rests, Zimmerl notices that the mechanical crab's tiny skittering sounds go silent. Sensing they are being scryed upon by Ilvara, he calls upon his drow arcane training and casts Darkness, confounding the Lolth priestess's efforts.</p>
<p>Day 37 – Alturiak 25&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">STEAM</span> <span class="caps">VENT</span><br>
Geological activity continues as a vent ruptures in a cavern ceiling as Zimmerl flies by upon Hor'lothchath, scalding the drow with steam. Prince Derendil remarks that the warm stone reminds him of the spa in his father's kingdom of Nelrindenvane.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BROWN</span> <span class="caps">MOLD</span>&nbsp;<br>
With Zimmerl aloft on his red wyrmling and the giant bat Vesper carrying both Zap and Yzak, it is Jimjar who leads the ground force. Though the stone at their feet feels abnormally warm (perhaps with a lava tube or steam vent running beneath it), the deep gnome feels a chill in the air as they travel through a narrow passage. As he comes to the tightest chokepoint of the tunnel, Jimjar's feels intense pain as the warmth is sucked from his body. Jimjar retreats to tend his wounds as the heroes descend from the air to investigate. They quickly find the source of the cold to be a patch of brown mold, which thrives on warmth. If they expose it to fire at all – luckily they have not, given the group's reliance on darkvision – it will grow dramatically in the direction of the heat. But, if they expose it to any extreme cold at all, it will instantly die. Before Zimmerl can destroy it with an icy ray, Yzak instead decides to harvest some of the mold in a glass jar, hoping to weaponize it as a grenade in the future.</p>
<p>Day 38 – Alturiak 26<br>
<span class="caps">DROW</span> <span class="caps">SCAVENGERS</span><br>
After another tough day's worth of travel through the Underdark, sustaining themselves on kuo-toa leviathan jerky as Yzak fails to find meat for his hook horror infants, Yzak is scouting ahead when he sees a drow mage leaning listlessly on his staff as he watches two bugbears – one albino, one jet black – secure the area. After a short while, a xorn emerges from the rock, striding out of the earth to gift the drow with a gem of some sort. The drow mage wears a house sigil of an adamantine flame.</p>
<p>Telepathically describing the scene to Zimmerl, the party's own drow processes the intelligence, and believes the mage to be a member of House Duskryn, a lesser house of Menzoberranzan chartered with salvage "rights" to the spellgem defenses of Blingdenstone. The bugbears must be his slave-bodyguards, and the xorn is either magically dominated or has entered into some agreement with House Duskryn for mutual aid.</p>
<p>Zimmerl commissions Zap to throw together a hasty disguise for him, masquerading as a noble of House Do'Urden – one of the ranking houses of Menzoberranzan, higher than any Duskryn drow. Zimmerl approaches the Duskryn confidently and alone, much to the mage's surprise, who asks where Zimmerl's own slaves might be, lamenting the loss of his own drow companions to a piercer attack and welcoming Zimmerl's arrival to break the dreariness of conversing with bugbears.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884113/Bugbear.PNG?1532763773"></p>
<p>After trying to commandeer one of the bugbears for his own – the albino – Zimmerl fails to convince the mage of the necessity, and the Duskryn tries to talk the "superior Do'Urden noble" into paying him for the inconvenience of losing a bodyguard in the open Underdark. Zimmerl instead charms the albino bugbear into surprise attacking his mage master. The rest of the heroes, springing from hiding, fall upon the mage with prejudice – Zap ensorcels him with hideous laughter, and Yzak has Vesper pin the cackling drow to the cavern floor, rendering him easy prey for Zap's blade. Meanwhile Yzak comes to Zap's aid with Dawnbringer slicing through the xorn. Zimmerl convinces the bugbears – captive chiefs – to follow his banner, revealing they themselves are escaped slaves – but when they ask if the party will let them take from the weak and murder those who cannot resist, their thuggish talk gets them roasted by Hor'lothchath's flame breath. In the aftermath, the group finds a pair of spellgems already scavenged by the group, and when Yzak learns of their value and power, he is quick to cast aside their task from Werz Saltbaron in Gracklstugh to deliver the sack of empty spellgems to Kazook Pickshine in Blingdenstone.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ARRIVING</span> AT <span class="caps">BLINGDENSTONE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Closing in on the reclaimed svirfneblin settlement, Jimjar announces his excitement to return to this bastion of civilization. Derendil doubtfully remarks that the drow at Velkynvelve spoke of this place as a monster-haunted ruin frequented by undesirables, to which Jimjar quickly counters that Blingdenstone, since it was retaken from the drow a decade ago, has become an up-and-coming frontier outpost, well on its way to recovery…or it will be soon.</p>
<p>Following Jimjar and Zap's lead, the group passes through a maze of tunnels toward the gnome village, bypassing the expertly concealed mines, quarries, mushroom fields, and forges that lie on its outskirts. At the end of a long day's march, the company arrives at the gates of Blingdenstone, forged of steel and mithral, inlaid with a secret magic-resistant alloy and plated with adamantine, set atop a staircase built for gnomish feet, meant to bedevil big folk who would storm the gate. An earth elemental stands to one side, ready to haul up a cart full of goods a merchant might try to bring within.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884114/BlingdenGate.PNG?1532763914"><br>
<br>
Meanwhile, eight svirfneblin emerge from an alcove, one of them scanning the heroes with a See Invisibility spell cast from a spellgem. The sergeant in charge speaks to Zap and Jimjar, cautiously greeting them back to Blingdenstone, but demanding to know why they are traveling with a drow, a kobold, and a red dragon. Zimmerl produces the head of the House Duskryn mage, which Zap uses the Stonespeaker Crystal to cast Speak With Dead upon, proving the party's anti-drow affiliation.</p>
<p>When the heroes start speaking of things like Zuggtmoy and Demogorgon, the sergeant decides to send them on with an armed four-gnome escort to meet Chief Dorbo Diggermattock – but he insists that Hor'lothchath be left at the gate. The wyrmling flies off in a huff to hunt while he waits for his master to emerge.</p>
<p><span class="caps">INNER</span> <span class="caps">BLINGDENSTONE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Passing through a nail-studded maze and a gauntlet guarded by two stone watchtowers, the group finds themselves in Inner Blingdenstone. The defenses of Outer Blingdenstone paint a picture of a paranoid people under siege, but Inner Blingdenstone reveals a warm, cozy, and welcoming township – a rarity in the Underdark. The group, as they pass with their escort, note that some caverns are closed off – perhaps to prevent discovery or invasion, perhaps by natural cave-in, perhaps remnants from the drow attack a century past, or perhaps to seal away some terrible threat. Passing a reclaimed temple to Segojan Earthcaller – gnomish deity of deep earth and nature – and a barricaded staging ground, the heroes are approached by a ghost which rises from the earth. The spectral deep gnome, who introduces himself as Burrow Warden Jadger, says that he was one of the thousands slain by conjured bebiliths during the drow attack a century ago, and has not quite let go of the defense of the settlement. Jadger promises to share his extensive (if outdated) knowledge of the Underdark if they will help put his fellow gnomish ghosts to rest. Asking if this includes Pelek, the gnome they found in the Whorlstone Tunnels, they are pleased when Jadger says yes.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DIGGERMATTOCK</span> <span class="caps">HALL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Moved along by their escort, the group comes to Diggermattock Hall, home to Chief Dorbo and Senni Diggermattock, and the provisional government of Blingdenstone. After hearing of their adventures, Chief Dorbo says that he has been looking for somebody capable of a vision he has, called "<span class="caps">OPERATION</span>: <span class="caps">OOZE</span> <span class="caps">THERE</span>?" He says that might be related to their rumors of a "Pudding King", and thinks that some monster or magic might be responsible for a growing number of oozes, slimes, jellies, and puddings in the area. His wife Senni does not neglect to mention another task: <span class="caps">OPERATION</span>: <span class="caps">EXTERMINATE</span>?. Some of the old city's caverns are still taken up by the Goldwhisker Clan, a group of gnomish wererats descended from refugees who fell prey to lycanthropy as they fled the Fall of Blingdenstone. Dorbo believes that the Goldwhiskers should be driven out to make valuable living space, while Senni posits they should be accepted into the community since they claim descent from the same forebears. As both groups are territorial and defensive, any attempt at parley has thus far been met with violence. The heroes, as outsiders, may be able to venture into the Goldwhisker warrens to speak with whomever is in charge, and their report to the Diggermattocks will determine if the gnomes will work to eliminate the wererats, or work toward an agreement.</p>
<p>Bringing up the matter of Plowfuddle, the estate for which they found the deed, the heroes are told that this abandoned home lies in Rockblight, a part of Blingdenstone that is as yet unclaimed. This area is haunted by Ogrémoch's Bane, a cloud of particles thought to be connected to Ogrémoch, the Elemental Prince of Evil Earth. The area is full of dangerous elementals, either commanded or driven into a rage by the presence of Ogrémoch's Bane.</p>
<p>Having just been welcomed into the svirfneblin town, the heroes find themselves for once in a supportive community, but not one without its problems.</p>

<p>Chapter Six: The City of Speaking Stones</p>
<p>Day 38 – Alturiak 26 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
AN <span class="caps">UNEXPECTED</span> <span class="caps">REUNION</span>&nbsp;<br>
With Quartermaster Senni having told Zap that the Rowsdower burrow has been re-assigned to other settlers given the settlement's dearth of living space, the heroes decide to head to deal with the malefic cloud Ogrémoch's Bane in Rockblight first, since Senni says that the Plowfuddle estate to which they hold the deed lies in that quarter. Meanwhile her husband Chief Dorbo recommends they stay the night at The Foaming Mug, the local inn.</p>
<p>As they make way to leave Diggermattock Hall, the party sees a pair of svirfneblin entering the doorway – gnomes with familiar faces. Topsy and Turvy, not seen since they evaded arrest by the Stoneguard in Gracklstugh twenty days prior, walk through the entryway gaunt and haggard. The gnomish wererat twins seem interested when the heroes mention their mission to treat with the chief of Clan Goldwhisker, the local wererat pack, but the heroes tactfully do not mention to the assembled svirfneblin that the twins are themselves cursed with lycanthropy. Quartermaster Senni, happy to receive these lost citizens, assigns them rudimentary temporary quarters, while telling Zap and Jimjar – who traffick with a drow and a kobold – that they should stay the evening at The Foaming Mug as well.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884118/Blingdenstone.PNG?1532764781"></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FOAMING</span> <span class="caps">MUG</span>&nbsp;<br>
Following a stream of off-duty miners, gemcutters, mushroom farmers, and militiamen, the party finds the inn on the far side of the residential zone, passing through tight tunnels. The bored proprietress, Tappy Foamstrap, is pleased out of her wits to see foreigners needing lodging. As the off-duty gnomes sip their fermented fish parts, Tappy excitedly pushes the heroes free rounds of duergar Darklake Stout, traded for at Mantol-Derith. She provides food as well, but in the svirfneblin habit this is served raw, as fires might reveal their hiding spots to murderous drow. Taking the uncooked mushrooms and heavily salted cave fish and rothé meat, Jagh takes it upon himself to cast Flaming Sphere in the middle of the Mug's taproom to "introduce the deep gnomes to fire". The gathered gnomes stand to arms at this fiery conjuration, the miners and warriors raising their picks in anger before the druid is able to calm them with a culinary display that delights their palates enough to calm them.</p>
<p>Plying the crowd for hearsay and rumors, the heroes focus on svirfneblin who have recently traveled outside the community – preferably to the hidden trading post of Mantol-Derith. One, an off-duty militiaman, says that he has escorted caravans there, and recommends against going there if one does not have specific business there, as it is a secret Underdark outpost inhabited by those who would be hostile to one another anywhere else, and tends to have an air of paranoia. Furthermore, while he marks its general location on the north side of the Darklake on the party's map, the guard stresses that it could still take months of wandering to find the place without a guide given the three-dimensional nature of the Underdark.</p>
<p>The warrior's friend, a miner, says that while returning with the last caravan from the gnomes' Whiteshell Salt Mine, he encountered a parade of dancing myconids and help rapport with them; it was doubly strange since they told the gnomes of a "wedding celebration" they were headed to, and the fungus folk do not have weddings.</p>
<p>The guard and his miner friend of his have a heated debate on whether to wipe out the Goldwhisker wererats as dangerous shapeshifting threats, or to accept them into the community as kin descended from the same gnomish forebears, banding against the threats of the Underdark. The party helps to defuse tensions, saying they have been tasked with speaking to the Goldwhisker leader(s), and distributing ale among the patrons – raising their hosts' attitudes from suspicious hostility to merely unfriendly. The off-duty warrior volunteers some additional intelligence: that a crazy svirfneblin, who disappeared in the first days of reclamation, has been spotted by militia&nbsp;scouts, skulking around the unrecovered areas of the settlement.</p>
<p>After the feasting and palaver, the locals make their way to their home burrows, and the party beds down on hay piles strewn around the stone floor of the taproom, finding what rest they can.</p>
<p>Day 39 – Alturiak 27&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">STONEHEART</span> <span class="caps">ENCLAVE</span>: <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RUBY</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ROUGH</span><br>
Deciding to make preparations and get to know the rest of Inner Blingdenstone before launching their expedition into Rockblight, the party breaks their fast at the Foaming Mug (Tappy insisting that Jagh cast Flaming Sphere again to cook with fire) and, as they are keenly interested in Spell Gems, decides to visit the Stoneheart Enclave, a group of gnomish spellcasters who left the surface-world faction The Emerald Enclave in order to focus on earth elemental magic. Leaving their followers behind at the Mug, they first head to The Ruby in the Rough, a temple to Segojan Earthcaller, the Lord of the Barrow, gnome god of deep earth and nature. Day-to-day rituals and duties here are seen to by a nervous young acolyte named Glyphic Shroomlight, the cleric on duty, who says that powerful magic like Spell Gems are left to others. As the gnomish dead are interred within Segojan's elemental province, Glyphic asks if Zap would like to visit the catacombs to pay respect to his ancestors. Entering the neat grid of the tombs, Zap reaches into the Bag of Holding and produces the severed hand of Pelek, deep gnome victim of Buppido. After reciting a prayer to Segojan, Glyphic is leading the party back up to the temple when a ghost crosses their path, re-enacting the events leading to its death in the Fall of Blingdenstone, when it was incinerated from within by the fiery poison bite of a bebilith.</p>
<p>Yzak, who remained in the temple proper while the others delved into the catacomb, lurks about the sanctified cavern, looking for an opening to steal the glowing ruby in its center, but the chance does not arise. Meanwhile the party's efforts are met with nay-saying from Balnur Berrybrewer, who is in no mood for idleness at the inn. The dwarf druid claims that the heroes are wasting time with the mundane troubles of this svirfneblin settlement, and that they should be making their way to warn the surface world of the presence of Abyssal princes on the Material Plane – most importantly King Bruenor Battlehammer of the dwarf-hold of Gauntlgrym. Further, as the "smartest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person he knows," Balnur believes that he can escape the Underdark single-handed and accomplish this errand of warning before the party anyhow. Unable to stop him, the party bids an exasperated farewell to Jagh's circle-mate.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">STONEHEART</span> <span class="caps">ENCLAVE</span>: <span class="caps">SPEAKING</span> <span class="caps">STONES</span>&nbsp;<br>
Deciding to visit a more powerful priest of the Enclave, the heroes venture to the nearby Speaking Stones, a circle of stone menhirs predating Blingdenstone. The gnomes believe this henge is a cluster of truly ancient galeb duhr, venerated as manifestations of the gods. The more religious Stoneheart members cast Augury or Commune here, interpreting responses to their entreaties through subtle changes in the vibrations in the bedrock below. At the circle's center they find Gurnik Tapfinger, head priest of Callarduran Smoothhands, the Deep Brother, gnome god of stone and mining and patron deity of the svirfneblin. Gurnik says that it is Yantha Coaxrock, a young female mage and leader of the Enclave, who is best able to enchant new Spell Gems, though he will be happy to loan them a jade one containing Hallow. Gurnik says that he will channel the goodwill of Callarduran, blessing the heroes, if they are willing to bring this Spell Gem into the Steadfast Stone, Callarduran's temple in the closed-off area known as Rockblight, battling the servants of Ogrémoch's Bane as they awaken the temple's guardians and reconsecrate the shrine.</p>
<p>Accepting this divine quest, as they were headed to Rockblight anyway, the party meets Nomi Pathshutter when she enters the cave to speak with Gurnik. Nomi is Yantha Coaxrock's apprentice, and is leading the wizards and druids of the Stoneheart Enclave while Yantha is on one of her extended trips to help the svirfneblin cartel in Mantol-Derith. Nomi is an earth elemental wrangler by specialty, and has devoted her life to protecting elementals from the evil influence of Ogrémoch's Bane. She offers to pay the heroes for any shards of corrupted elementals they may find in Rockblight, giving them another reason to venture to try to reclaim that district first.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VAZUK</span>'S <span class="caps">HOME</span>&nbsp;<br>
Leaving the Speaking Stones, the party hears a commotion as a pair of svirfneblin rush up to them from out of a nearby residential cave. They were assigned to live here by Quartermaster Senni, except when they tried to move into this hovel, a poltergeist manifested and is throwing a fit! The heroes dash in, Zap casting See Invisibility to detect the spectre, seeing the shade of a simple leatherworker throwing pottery as Vazuk's poltergeist terrorizes anyone trying to enter his home in life. The "ghost" is quickly put to rest.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TRADER</span>'S <span class="caps">GROTTO</span>&nbsp;<br>
Visiting this cavern featuring makeshift stalls amid petrified stalks of fungus, the heroes pass by caravans lowering their cargo to a subterranean warehouse to find the stall of Kazook Pickshine, an alchemist and ore specialist and member of the most influential family in the Blingdenstone Miner's Guild. Kazook, they also know, has black market dealings in Spell Gems. When they quietly ask him about these goods, he ushers them into his stall, asking how they knew of his dealings (they were hired by Werz Saltbaron in Gracklstugh to deliver a sack of gems that Zap recognized as empty Spell Gems), but gets no answers from the tight-lipped wanderers – who do not deliver the gems, instead opting to keep the gems for themselves. They do ask Kazook where his connection is, learning that he has a contact in Mantol-Derith, which is where he met Werz.</p>
<p>Leaving Kazook's stall, a clanging bell sounds as the deep gnomes around the heroes all draw weapons and draw back as a guard stumbles back from the sealed-off tunnel to the north, then rises up in the air. A strange shimmer reveals the surface of the gelatinous cube that has engulfed him – one of two intruding on the grotto. Yzak heroically plunges into the acidic ooze, saving the gnome – a veteran guard named Mev Flintknapper – though both Yzak and Mev are badly corroded. Against this gelatinous cube incursion, another one arrives – Glabbagool! The intelligent, telepathic ooze pours up out of a hole in the ground, bidding welcome to its former companions, and interposes itself between the heroes and the enemy cubes, distracting them as it tries to intimidate them and Mev joins his swords to the battle. Yzak repeatedly leaps through the oozes to save his fellows from horrible death, earning the grudging respect of the many gnomish witnesses and improving the party's regard from unfriendly to simply neutral.</p>
<p>One of these newly impressed locals hawks his wares from his stall, looking to barter with these travelers. As the trader – whose name is Pingtu – offers exotic svirfneblin weaponry like crystal caltrops filled with sleep gas or darts filled with acid, Yzak especially is intrigued with the possibilities, as the ranger is constantly trying to weaponize dungeon hazards and exotic fungi of the Underdark.</p>
<p><span class="caps">URBAN</span> <span class="caps">WARFARE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Finally ready to enter Rockblight, the party passes through the fortified staging area where the settlement's militia constantly drills. Before they can reach the sealed outer gate, a pair of deep gnomes approach them – and attack Zap! The gnomes prove a bit tougher to down than would seem usual, and Yzak works out that they are wererats in their humanoid form. This theory is proven correct when the first one is slain, returning to its natural hybrid form on its death. Yzak quickly throws his blanket over the corpse to hide it from the swiftly-approaching militia, and asks Zap to cast an illusion of the attacker's gnomish form over the body, while the second assailant is knocked unconscious. The gnome militia lieutenant, Sark Axebarrel, demands to know why the group just slew two svirfneblin, but does not recognize either of the Clan Goldwhisker members, and when Zap casts Speak With Dead via the Stonespeaker Crystal, the corpse says that it attacked him because he was a gnome. Not wanting to inflame tensions between the two factions, the heroes hide the nature of their foes, and when Sark commands his men to bring the dead one to the catacombs and the live one to Diggermattock Hall – the heroes volunteer to inter the dead one themselves, successfully bluffing their intentions.</p>
<p>Now done with business in town, the group asks Sark Axebarrel to open the doors to the unclaimed areas of Blingdenstone beyond. The gnome obliges, offering a bounty if they can scout the lair of the medusa which he warns them lies beyond: a certain Neheedra Duskryn, once a drow priestess, now cursed for her hubris in seeking to make herself the proud and regal mistress of her own Underdark realm.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ELEMENTAL</span> <span class="caps">VAGABONDS</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">BRACE</span> OF <span class="caps">GARGOYLES</span><br>
The scouting group (Yzak and Zap mounted on Vesper) flies ahead as the spellcasters walk behind, finding abandoned residences that mirror Inner Blingdenstone's, but barren, cold, and hostile, littered with rubble, and the air is damp and chill. Flying deeper into the cavern to investigate echoes of battle, the scouts see a distant mephit – a capricious, imp-like trickster native to the elemental planes. This particular one is a dust mephit (amalgam of earth and air, drawn to catacombs, known to find death morbidly fascinating), and it is guiding an earth elemental through the caverns and passages.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884121/DustMephit.PNG?1532765813"><br>
<br>
The party descends upon the dust mephit with overwhelming force, in the vain hope that its brutish companion might thank them for slaying the "brains" of the duo. Meanwhile a pair of winged statues break free of a cliff ahead, engaging in midair clash with the scout party while the earth elemental burrows underground to ambush Zimmerl as he stands undefended. The mystic proves able to protect himself, blasting the elemental with rays of thunder that resonate through its mineral body.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UDHASK</span>'S <span class="caps">HOME</span><br>
The echoing sounds of battle continue, and always seem to originate just beyond the party's' range of darkvision. Moving to investigate toward the apparent source, the echoes become more distant. Yzak and Zap see a svirfneblin ghost appear before them, frightening most of the party – and aging the bat Vesper by twenty years. Despite its horrifying visage, it warns them "They are coming! Everyone must hide!" and grabs Yzak by the shoulders with its ethereal hands, inadvertently threatening him with its withering touch. The ghost flees toward an old burrow, which Jagh sprints to before it can reach the home. Within, the elf finds gnomish skeletal remains lying next to a stone bed, appearing to reach beneath it. Meanwhile the other heroes defeat this manifestation of the ghost – but do not put it to rest. Yzak finds no sign of a violent death, so Zap casts Speak With Dead on the skeleton, finding in life his name was Udhask, and that when the drow attacked Blingdenstone, Udhask had a heart attack and died while reaching for his loot – some gems and a Potion of Invisibility. Zap speaks to him in Thieves' Cant to no avail. The party puts Udhask's remains into the Bag of Holding to entomb him in Segojan's catacombs and put his soul to rest.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">OVERLOOK</span>: <span class="caps">PLOWFUDDLE</span>&nbsp;<br>
The scouts fly past a waterfall and a pair of stone staircases framing an overlook festooned with fungi and crystalline formations, Zap reading the manor's name in Gnomish on the doorframe: "Plowfuddle." As they look around the unwelcoming cave, an insane earth elemental arises out of the ground, laying about with its great stone fists and causing a near cave-in. In the rubble the elemental leaves behind as it is destroyed, Zap spies a yellow diamond that he knows must be an Earth Elemental Gem. Capitalizing on their vantage point and relative seclusion to take a brief rest, the heroes vow to clean up this place and claim it for their own, and move deeper into Rockblight.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DROW</span> <span class="caps">STATUES</span>&nbsp;<br>
The party comes across a cave filled with thirty statues of dark elf warriors bearing the crest of House Duskryn, carved in a warding poise. The party's suspicions of the stone soldiery are proven right when the statues begin to animate and charge the party – having been charged to scout for a medusa's lair, they expected these drow to have been her victims, and are unsurprised when they are animated by the elemental meddling of Ogrémoch's Bane. In defending against the wave attacks of these mobile statues, the party displays tactical acumen combined with judicious spellcasting, with Jagh creating a chokepoint by cutting off the cave's mouth with a Wall of Flame. Precious few of the moving statues make it through the barrier, sniped by crossbows or Zimmerl's thunderous blasts, and those that do are quickly hewn down by the line of melee fighters waiting behind the wall. When the last one crumbles apart, a cloud of dust expands from its shattered remains and the heroes feel a malevolence not of their world as it expands to fill the cave. Unable to banish Ogrémoch's Bane from the Material Plane, the heroes uneasily leave the evil presence behind, knowing it still lingers to enslave elementals anew.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NEHEEDRA</span>'S <span class="caps">LAIR</span>&nbsp;<br>
The stealthy heroes, following Yzak's ranging, are able to follow fresh signs of passage to a nearby cavern where they find the medusa Neheedra Duskryn holding court in solitude, reposed on her zurkhwood throne surrounded be fiendish giant spiders. Fine zurkhwood furniture, racks of elegant gowns, and spider-themed tapestries adorn the hall of this would-be monarch, all of it old and rotted. Zap and Yzak skirt the edges of Neheedra's sanctum, hiding amidst the tainted opulence; the two diminutive skulks exhaustively scout the chamber before determining a simple plan of attack: both of them mount Vesper, who flies them directly in front of the medusa. Neheedra hisses in anger at the intrusion upon her realm, the pale snakes that are her hair joining her in chorus – and looking directly into the twin mirrors presented by Yzak and Zap. As Zimmerl and Jagh watch from afar, the medusa is petrified by her own accursed power, brought low by the very price of her own hubris. Her fiendish spider attendants return shrieking to the Demonweb Pits of the Abyss where they were spawned.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884119/Medusa.PNG?1532765574"></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">STEADFAST</span> <span class="caps">STONE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Soon finding a great menhir carved from a stalagmite pockmarked with dozens of sockets in a smooth-floored cavern, the heroes array themselves in ambush as they prepare for the elemental onslaught promised by Gurnik Tapfinger. Jagh places Gurnik's hallowed Spell Gem into one of the menhir's sockets, and an earth elemental wrenches itself from the rough cavern wall, charging the druid. The party falls upon the vaguely humanoid thing from all directions, quickly felling it – and they are joined in their defense of the stone by a galeb duhr, which rises from its long dormancy to defend Callarduran's sacred stone once more. Three elementals attack in succession from the stone walls, and each time one is destroyed, another galeb duhr joins the defense.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884120/GalebDuhr.PNG?1532765633"><br>
<br>
The galeb duhr's signature move, a rolling charge, aids the party's own assaults. Once the servants of Ogrémoch's Bane are vanquished, the three galeb duhr give the heroes a grave nod, returning to their boulder guise and their silent vigil. A white light shines from the menhir over the re-hallowed shrine.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GROVELING</span> <span class="caps">GANG</span> OF <span class="caps">MEPHITS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Finding a collapsed passage north toward the territory of the so-called "Pudding Court" which would take several days of labor to clear, the heroes determine they have effectively cleared Rockblight, with the notable exception of Ogrémoch's Bane – the root of the area's dangers. On their way back to Inner Blingdenstone, they run across four more mephits in the residential area. This time it is two of the morbid dust mephits, plus two of the slow, unctuous creatures of earth and water that are mud mephits. The mephits taunt and mock the party in the Terran dialect of Primordial,but before Jagh (in giant constrictor form) can crush them with the petrified medusa he is dragging, Zimmerl contacts the extraplanar tricksters telepathically. Making a show of strength by having Snake-Jagh toss about Neheedra's stone form, Zimmerl cows the cowards. In awe, the mephits abase themselves before the mystic, begging for their miserable lives. Though Zap mentions he might need custodians at his newly-claimed estate at Plowfuddle, Yzak astutely notes that creatures of dust and mud are unlikely to keep the place clean. Zimmerl instead accepts their services as skulking spies, sending them to surveil the Pudding King's demesne or die in the attempt.<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884330/MudMephit.PNG?1532795724"></p>
<p><span class="caps">RETURNING</span> TO <span class="caps">INNER</span> <span class="caps">BLINGDENSTONE</span>&nbsp;<br>
When the heroes knock on the gate leading to the militia's staging area, Sark Axebarrel opens it only to see the massive eye of Snake-Jagh. The shapeshifted elf barrels through the gate, with Zap riding on his back – the arcane trickster glamered with the image of a mephit. As the deep gnomes draw their steel, the heroes return to their true forms, and Sark duly rewards them with a flawless diamond for defeating the dread medusa. Sark leaves a token force to defend the gate as he leads a mounted troop of giant badger-riding cavalry to sweep through Rockblight and mop up any remaining elemental threats so the community can try to hold the ground cleared by the heroes, noting to Zimmerl that holding ground is different than seizing it, in an apparent knock against drow strategy after the Fall of Blingdenstone.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CALLARDURAN</span>'S <span class="caps">BLESSING</span>&nbsp;<br>
Back at the Speaking Stones, Gurnik Tapfinger already seems to know that the Steadfast Stone has been restored to his deity. Using the shrine's power, he channels blessings of the Deep Brother's protection upon the heroes. His fellow Stoneheart Enclave member, Nomi Pathshutter, further rewards the heroes, paying them for their retrieval of fragments from the gargoyles and insane earth elemental from Plowfuddle. She furthermore warns Zap that the Earth Elemental Gem he found there is cursed, and dispels this evil magic. With their race's patron deity's shrine restored, the svirfneblin of Blingdenstone finally let down their guard and become friendly to this wandering band of heroes, who still seek to resolve the community's relations with the adjacent rulers of the Goldwhisker Clan of wererats and the inscrutable Pudding Court.</p>

<p>Day 39 – Alturiak 27 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">RUMORS</span> OF <span class="caps">POWER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having been rewarded by the Stoneheart Enclave and accepted by the svirfneblin at large for restoring the Steadfast Stone, the heroes retire to the Foaming Mug to while away the rest of the day before attempting a meeting with whomever may lead the wererat pack.</p>
<p>Waiting for the wacky weaponsmith Pingtu to come in for a pint, Yzak buys a round for the house to loose tongues about any rare minerals, preferably his pet favorite item, Spell Gems. A (perhaps crazed) miner insists that, a day to the west of town, he once glimpsed what he swears was the entrance to Entemoch's Boon. Zap knows that Entemoch's Boon, if it exists, is where the deep gnomes once summoned Entemoch, Prince of Earth Elementals, to the Material Plane. Ever since, it is said that Entemoch's power suffuses the cavern, and empowers summoned earth elementals. The location of the Boon was a secret lost with the Fall of Blingdenstone, and now the Stoneheart Enclave are some of the few who have even heard of it – and so finding it would help the resurgent gnome community greatly.</p>
<p>An old svirfneblin woman named Henkala Shadowsong enters the Mug and joins the conversation, saying that she recently saw a pech – a shy, willowy, earth-aligned diminutive fey – flitting about near the Armorers &amp; Weaponsmiths Guild in the Caves of Clatter. She says that she is too old to do anything about it, but believes that the pechs' connection to the earth would mean that if anyone knows how to get rid of Ogrémoch's Bane, it is them. She says that the heroes will have the gratitude of an old woman if they contact the skittish pechs and ally with them against the evil cloud, winking at Zap. Though they had been planning to visit Entemoch's Boon first, the heroes decide instead to return to Rockblight in the morning.</p>
<p>As Henkala leaves the inn's taproom, she brushes shoulders with Pingtu. The innovative armsmonger sits with the heroes, and excitedly shows them his "gnome calculus", an oversized sling capable of launching alchemical ammunition, or orbs containing the various toxins, molds, acids, and spores collected during the heroes' journey. Pingtu happily sets to work weaponizing their exotic items, telling them to check back in a few days.</p>
<p>After their information gathering, the party socializes a while before the inn clears out, and they pay Tappy Foamstrap for some straw mats on the floor.</p>
<p>Day 40 – Alturiak 28&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">MEETING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PECHS</span>&nbsp;<br>
The heroes go to the Caves of Clatter, where Zimmerl spots a lithe and willowy humanoid, just taller than a gnome, flitting behind a stalagmite. Jagh investigates, and is pensively approached by the pech – who had actually darted <strong>within</strong> the stalagmite. He introduces himself as Gallus, a leader among his kindred. Gallus has little to say about his shy and reclusive race, except that they are creatures of earth who speak to the stone, and it responds as it grows and flows. The pechs, though not hostile to the svirfneblin, are not allies of the gnomes: they have spent a great deal of effort repairing the "wounded caverns" of the mines since the drow expelled the gnomes from Blingdenstone, and they do not approve of the svirfneblins' binding of elementals. Nonetheless they agree that the gnomes must have a home, and it may as well be here, where damage has already been done.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884331/Pech.jpg?1532796242"><br>
<br>
Gallus theorizes that Ogrémoch's Bane, which he calls the Raging Spirit, has manifested in response to the svirfneblins' treatment of earth elementals, and will only disperse if Entemoch's Boon is destroyed – which he is willing to help them do, against the gnomes' wishes. Gallus also says that if anyone knows elementals, it is the pechs, and he is also willing to help them confront Ogrémoch's Bane directly. The heroes decide on a direct path, and after Gallus calls upon a dozen of his fellow pechs to step out of the stone and join, the heroes are off.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RETURN</span> TO <span class="caps">ROCKBLIGHT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Going back to the cavern featuring the crystal garden and the shattered drow "statues" they left behind, the heroes again feel the evil presence of Ogrémoch's Bane. As the dust cloud fills the chamber in defiance of their presence, an earth elemental charges the group – which the pechs, through group effort, are able to calm. The pechs form a protective circle around the heroes, Gallus promising they will aid the party in any way they can as they talk to the Bane or somehow destroy it. With its minions held at bay by the pechs' ward, the cloud that is Ogrémoch's Bane begins to swirl in anger, pebbles and dust coalescing. The spirit looms over the heroes, a deep voice laughing and asking what puny mortals have come seeking plunder. The heroes and Ogrémoch's Bane converse, with the Raging Spirit calling upon them to topple and shatter the stones of Entemoch's Boon, so that they might end the svirfneblin practice of calling and binding earth elementals. Until then, the elemental promises to undo the gnomes' works, and to free their elemental servants. The heroes decide to remain on the side of the "miserable gnomes", Zimmerl blasting Ogrémoch's Bane with raw psionic power. The spirit takes on a gargantuan, bloated humanoid form as the swirling gravel coalesces.<br>

<p><span class="caps">BATTLING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BANE</span>&nbsp;<br>
The pechs quickly raise a low stone wall that encircles the heroes, parting the maelstrom that whirls around them and keeping the enraged elementals at bay – which besiege their circle, bashing away at the rampart. Yzak and Zap assault the gigantic Ogrémoch's Bane on Vesper's back, and are immediately pelted with debris as the giant bat pushes through the supernatural whirlwind, though they are lucky in avoiding the elemental's crushing fists. Jagh meanwhile casts Wall of Fire, encircling the pechs' own stone wall to bedevil the enemy elementals. Gallus kneels down and picks up a rock, causing it to glow, and hands it to the druid, letting him channel its power through his spellcasting. Zimmerl blasts away with his psionic talents.</p>
<p>Zap, with his Booming Blade and deadly sneak attacks, and Yzak with the radiant blade of Dawnbringer, are able to deal devastating damage to Ogrémoch's Bane, but find it to be an immensely resilient foe. With Vesper compelled to retreat to the pechs' circle for healing thanks to the pelting rocks of the whirlwind, Yzak jumps on Ogrémoch's Bane's back to keep up the offensive, and is promptly grabbed and thrown against the cavern wall, losing consciousness. After Vesper is healed, the bat flies through the rockstorm to Yzak, bringing a life-saving potion to his master. Meanwhile Zap jumps on the Raging Spirit's back as well, and Ogrémoch's Bane throws him in the other direction, likewise knocking him out. The rogue nearly bleeds out before he receives a medevac as well, and goes up against Ogrémoch's Bane again as the elven spellcasters Zimmerl and Jagh continue weaving their magic within the pechs' ward, beset by elementals. Zimmerl telekinetically pulls the monster into the Wall of Flame, but it is Yzak who deals the mortal blow to Ogrémoch's Bane with his mighty sunblade, knocking its towering form collapsing to the cavern floor. The handful of elementals which survived Jagh's Wall of Flame scorching them as they beset the pechs, now purposeless, turn to wander away and seek out pathways back to the Inner Planes. Gallus and the pechs quietly merge back into the stone, gently reminding the heroes to nurture the earth. Rockblight has finally, truly been cleared of its elemental threat.</p>
<p>Returning to the Speaking Stones in Inner Blingdenstone, the party finds Nomi Pathshutter and Gurnik Tapfinger of the Stoneheart Enclave. Before Nomi returns to Stoneheart Quarry, the party tells the geomancer of their momentous feat of arms. Jagh provides the being's massive mica "eyes" as mute evidence of their deed. Astonished by the news (and somewhat crestfallen that her life's work of protecting against the spirit's corruption is now superfluous), Nomi gives them an amethyst, a magical handaxe, and several potions as a reward and returns to Stoneheart Quarry, her work here done.</p>

Walking through the settlement, the party sees several militia warriors running out of Diggermattock Hall, clearly in hot pursuit of some fugitive – doubtless the captured lycanthrope. Zap hears them call out orders to sweep the maze, and so the party heads toward the fortified labyrinth at the city's entrance, hoping to catch the runaway wererat before he is killed, perhaps causing a diplomatic crisis before their consular mission to Clan Goldwhisker. Zimmerl, caring little for the svirfneblin internal affairs, cools his heels in the entry hall. Meanwhile Jagh takes on quetzlcoatlus form with Zap and Yzak riding on his back, the party hoping that a swift aerial search might find the wererat (lurking in animal form) before the gnomish militia. First, they find a gang of four svirfneblin teenagers who have taken to the shadows, hiding among the battlements on the walls. They are armed with household improvised weapons, and appear to be lying in ambush. Zap jumps off of Jagh, landing next to the youths. Their leader, Trisk Adamantelpiece, indignantly grouses that Zap has ruined their hiding spot. Zap, who at first had thought them to be wererat guerillas, is bemused to learn that this group calls themselves the New Burrow Wardens.&nbsp;For the last year they have been training in secret under the eye of the ghost of Burrow Warden Jadger, who is grooming Trisk to command the protectors of the svirfneblin, and to carry on their honored memory. Meanwhile, Jagh spots the fleeing rat further down the maze, and Zap casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter upon him. The angsty Adamantelpiece is frustrated his Wardens didn't get a chance to prove themselves, but the adult heroes see it as preventing inexperienced amateurs from botching the mission or getting themselves hurt. Interrogating the wererat, the heroes learn that he was trying to make it to a secret passage unknown to the svirfneblin hidden in the maze, and they intimidate him into promising to bring them to the Goldwhisker chieftain, Chipgrin. Returning him to the Diggermattocks, Chief Dorbo promises to increase security and to allow the wererat to accompany them to the warrens whenever they are ready.</p>

<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ROAD</span> <span class="caps">LESS</span> <span class="caps">TRAVELED</span>&nbsp;<br>
After another night at the Foaming Mug – this time with Tappy finally asking them to pay – the heroes go to Zap's new manor of Plowfuddle in Rockblight, currently in ruin. They decide to leave Jimjar in charge as steward, directing efforts to restore and repair the dwelling for the party to use as their base of operations. Leaving the other followers to aid him, the heroes decide that before going on an embassy to the wererats to quell the town's racial tensions, they should jaunt off to the west in search of Entemoch's Boon, the elemental legend mentioned by the pechs. Arming themselves with clues provided by the old miner in the tavern, the heroes set out.</p>

The heroes head west through the Underdark and begin their search for Entemoch's Boon.</p>

<p>Day 44 – Ches 2&nbsp;<br>
While looking for signs of Entemoch's Boon, the heroes are approached by a xorn, hungry for gems. Zap allows the elemental its precious food, paying it to guide them to a curious waymarker that matches the miner's claims: a small pyramid of carefully stacked stones next to the mouth of a tunnel. Parting ways with the xorn, the party follows this new path.</p>
<p>Day 45 – Ches 3&nbsp;<br>
Soon after breaking camp, the party happens upon an earth elemental being led through the Underdark by a dust mephit. Zimmerl telepathically contacts the mephit, and overawes the pathetic creature, terrifying it by saying that he is Entemoch, and demands these beings prove their faith to him by making a pilgrimage to his Boon, never turning to face behind them. The miserable, implike mephit cowers before the unseen mystic, and the party easily follows it for several hours before arriving at a tunnel flanked by the sculpted faces of male and female deep gnomes. Led by the mephit, the party dispenses with searching the many side passages hidden by rock formations, and heads directly to the Boon. They come out on a ledge high above a boulder-strewn cavern floor filled with stalagmites and stalactites. In the center are three twisting columns engraved with bright runes; the columns surround a summoning circle carved into the ground. The earth thrums with energy here. Zimmerl commands the dust mephit to turn around once it is in the summoning circle, revealing himself ("his avatar"). It is here, among the stones of the Boon, that Zap breaks his Earth Elemental Gem, summoning an earth elemental empowered by Entemoch, Prince of Earth.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884335/EarthElem.PNG?1532797076"></p>
<p>As the mephit praises Entemoch's power in the summoning circle, Zimmerl notes shattered bits of statuary littering the cavern floor – and that they are actually the petrified remains of cave vermin. As he investigates, a mated pair of basilisks swarm out of a pit in the ground, biting at him and attempting to petrify him with their gaze. After they are killed, Yzak harvests their gullets, knowing their bile has value to alchemists. Checking out their nest of pulverized stone, the beastmaster finds three 6-inch, 20-pound spheres with pebbled gray shells as hard as stone – basilisk eggs. Knowing that basilisks raised in captivity are sought-after guard beasts, Yzak harvests the eggs, hoping to add them to his ever-growing menagerie.<br>
<br>

<p>Day 46 – Ches 4&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">PICKSHINE</span> <span class="caps">MINES</span>&nbsp;<br>
Now knowing the way back to Blingdenstone, the return journey is much easier. In Outer Blingdenstone, the group is passing by an intersection of the major routes heading to the inner city, when they happen to spy the entrance to Pickshine Mines, an interconnected mine complex, their entrances engineered to all meet at this entryway, heavily guarded by gnomes and galeb duhr. The mines produce mostly iron and copper, but rarer ores like mithral or adamantine are extracted here as well, as well as gems from all manner of crystal caverns. The gnome in charge of general operations, Dasco Pickshine, is overseeing the loading of a cargo of ores bound for Inner Blingdenstone as the heroes pass by. Jagh is unsettled by Pickshine's tireless exhortations for his men to work faster so Blingdenstone might sooner return to her former glory, but when he spots one of them pocketing a small gem, he is quick to call out the miner for this theft. Conversation suddenly escalates between the gnomes and the party, and soon enough Dasco and Zap are dueling. Dasco calls upon their race's power to blur themselves, to no avail against Zap's arcane trickery of Tasha's Hideous Laughter. As the overseer rolls around, wracked by mirth, Zap takes up a pickaxe handle and smashes the nose of the gnome who had just hired them for an escort job. With that, the party takes up defensive positions around the ore-laden cart and heads east.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884339/Svirfn.PNG?1532797251"></p>
<p>That afternoon, Zap's earth elemental detects a threat ahead: a gelatinous cube that would otherwise have dissolved the rothé drawing the wagon. The heroes destroy the cube, and the psychic gray ooze lying in wait nearby, no doubt preventing them from joining the Pudding Court.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PUTTING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HOUSE</span> IN <span class="caps">ORDER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Upon arrival at the settlement, the cart is hauled up to the gate by a winch-turning elemental and directed to a path over the maze. Passing through the Reception Hall to the Trader's Grotto, Miner's Guild laborers begin unloading the cargo to a warehouse carved out beneath the grotto. Meanwhile the slightly shady alchemist Kazook Pickshine (Dasco's nephew) approaches the party, paying them for the shipment, and happily accepting the basilisk organs for his own purposes. At the Speaking Stones, Gurnik Tapfinger is overjoyed when the heroes bring a detailed map with directions to lost Entemoch's Boon, gaining them favor in the eyes of the Stoneheart Enclave. Jimjar reports steady progress at Plowfuddle, where the battle damage has been repaired, and sturdy zurkhwood furniture brought in.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PARLEY</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">CLAN</span> <span class="caps">GOLDWHISKER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Though the Diggermattocks are irked that the heroes spent six days chasing elemental legends, they gladly release the wererat prisoner to go with the heroes on their diplomatic foray. The party consents to unbind him and even arm him with a shortsword, and after joining up with Topsy and Turvy at the Foaming Mug (who are interested in learning more about the wererat clan), the party sets out. At the party's insistence, the prisoner brings them through the fortified maze, revealing the location of the secret tunnel to the warrens. Believing their guide that taking a left turn will lead to the old Hall of Miners, which the wererats have set up as their main square (and furthermore that the way is not trapped), the heroes are pleasantly surprised when it turns out he is telling the truth.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884340/Blingden_Wererat.PNG?1532797301"></p>
<p>A crowd of forty wererats are gathered here, led by a fat, smiling specimen with jagged buckteeth. Introducing himself as Chipgrin, chief of the clan, he invites the heroes to join him on a rise covered in manicured moss, where he sits on a stone chair draped with a giant badger pelt and flanked by two giant rats. The wererat boss says that the Goldwhisker svirfneblin have lived in Blingdenstone for decades, and are descended from the last citizens to hold out against the drow invasion. They have come to thrive in these caverns, avoiding drow and crazed elementals, and securing their home in vicious and cunning ways – and they aren't about to leave just because the cowards who abandoned Blingdenstone when it needed them most have come back to squat here.</p>
<p>Chipgrin gets down to brass hobnails and says that his kin have recently come under constant assault by oozes of the Pudding Court. He knows of the mysterious figure who controls them – the Pudding King – and offers to take the heroes directly to him. The chief remains civil, but refuses to tell any more about the Pudding King until he meets with the Diggermattocks. Affable but firm in his demands, he asks if they have noticed anything odd about the svirfneblin lately – leaping on the evidence when the party mentions the greed and curtness encountered at the Pickshine Mines. Chipgrin says that some evil influence seems to be affecting the gnomes living on the city's outskirts, and no doubt Inner Blingdenstone will soon be corrupted as well. If the Diggermattocks are amenable, Chipgrin calls for an end to their urban warfare, and an alliance against the unending hunger of the oozes. He is pleased to welcome Topsy and Turvy into his clan, hearing of their desperate flight from Gracklstugh.</p>
<p>The heroes descend from Chipgrin's plateau having arranged for him to meet with Chief Dorbo and Quartermaster Senni Diggermattock at noon the next day, with the heroes invited to stick around to "see what comes of all this chit-chat and howdy-do". Meanwhile, they find themselves next door to the mysterious Pudding Court…</p>

<span class="caps">PUNCHING</span> <span class="caps">THROUGH</span> TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PUDDING</span> <span class="caps">COURT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having arranged for a meeting between chiefs Dorbo and Chipgrin at noon the next day, the heroes decide that they should bring something to the table themselves when they attend this parley, to wit, intelligence on the Pudding Court. Going to the Steadfast Stone shrine in recently-cleared Rockblight with the aim to clear away the fallen debris, the heroes find military officer Sark Axebarrel and a militia squad hard at work clearing the passage themselves. Zap's earth elemental conjured at Entemoch's Boon is offered to ease the excavation; the gnomes, though still wary of bringing elementals to Rockblight, are pleased at the results when the rocky siege monster pounds its way through the stone with alacrity.</p>
<p>IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HALL</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PUDDING</span> <span class="caps">KING</span>&nbsp;<br>
Jagh takes the lead in giant constrictor form, trusting in his blindsight in case the ever-treacherous (and transparent) gelatinous cubes should lie in their path. Though seeking to make peaceful contact with the Pudding Court, still with the idea of a league against Zuggtmoy in the backs of their minds, the heroes are beset by danger. After Jagh is struck by falling green slime, Yzak flies to the cavern's roof upon Vesper, and when he ignites Dawnbringer to get a better look, the sunblade's light destroys swaths of the noxious slime, which falls in embers to the floor.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884345/Ochre_Jelly.PNG?1532798561"></p>
<p>After Jagh scouts out a small pool (battling a pair of ochre jellies), the group comes to a smaller chamber lit by phosphorescent lichen – the Pudding King's throne room. The walls here are covered in green slime, with patches on the ceiling, and pools of it gathered on the floor. At the chamber's center stands a chiseled stone throne, sculpted with lidless eyes and gaping mouths. Seeing that its cap is removable, Yzak steals forward toward the throne's fungal footrest, a petrified toadstool. With Dawnbringer ignited to its greatest extent, green slime sloughs off of the walls and ceiling as the kobold approaches, thieving scrolls, potions, and other treasures – including a varnished nothic eye that will function once as a Crystal Ball of True Seeing. Meanwhile Zimmerl plants a psychic sensor on the throne.</p>
<p>As this band of burglars infiltrates his sanctum, the Pudding King's disembodied voice fills the cave: "What's this, what's this? Visitors? Now? Not yet! We're not ready! Go away, pests! I will call upon thee and all of Blingdenstone to announce our glad tidings of the Faceless Lord to come at the proper time! Begone!". With that, hundreds of ooze creatures – black puddings, gray oozes, ochre jellies, and the occasional gelatinous cube – begin to pour into the chamber. As they back away from the oncoming slime army, a familiar "face" appears next to the party – the telepathic gelatinous cube Glabbagool pours out of a narrow hole in the porous rock: it attempts to communicate with the other creatures, telling the heroes that others of its kind are calling out for it to join them and their Faceless Lord. Though the heroes appeal to Glabbagool's sense of adventure in learning of the other races of the Underdark, the cube ultimately leaves to join its fellows.</p>
<p>The heroes withdraw to the Steadfast Stone, where Sark Axebarrel looks at them as madmen as they discuss whether or not to engage this irresistible mass. Meanwhile the adventurous New Burrow Wardens arrive, meaning to brave the Pudding Court's frontiers themselves – the party sends their leader Trisk Adamantelpiece back to Inner Blingdenstone to warn the Diggermattocks and call for aid. Although there is serious talk from Yzak and Jagh that the party should stand against them here and now, Zap convinces the group to withdraw to the Steadfast Stone. Chief Dorbo arrives in full panoply with his clan champions, but when he sees the oncoming jelly host, he turns his badger mount around and calls for a retreat. The heroes tell him of Chief Chipgrin's amenability to a meeting, having not reported back to Diggermattock Hall before scouting the Pudding Court, to which the svirfneblin chief responds that tomorrow will be too late. Meanwhile Sark Axebarrel commands the rearguard, while the Steadfast Stone's galeb duhr guardians begin plugging holes in the rock to prevent ooze invasion of their hallowed ground.</p>
<p><span class="caps">COUNCIL</span> OF <span class="caps">WAR</span>&nbsp;<br>
An hour later, the heroes have fetched Chipgrin from Goldwhisker Warrens, and have returned to Diggermattock Hall to find Blingdenstone's faction leaders gathered: Chief Dorbo and Quartermaster Senni Diggermattock, Chief Chipgrin of Clan Goldwhisker, Gurnik Tapfinger of the Stoneheart Enclave, Kazook Pickshine of the Miners' Guild, Trisk Adamantelpiece of the New Burrow Wardens, and the ghost of Burrow Warden Jadger for the svirfneblin spirits. The deep gnome leaders grimly thank everyone for attending, with Senni opening the meeting asking the heroes to inform everyone what they saw. Hearing this, Jadger suggests that Blingdenstone has no hope to defeat this threat if the settlement stands divided – meaning counting the Goldwhisker wererats as allies and recognizing their right to rejoin the community – had he survived the drow invasion, the ghost would likely be one of the wererats today.</p>
<p>Chief Dorbo is suspicious of the lycanthropes, and initially is unwilling to consider more than a battlefield truce before Yzak lays out the core of their conflict: Dorbo wishes rid of the Goldwhiskers for want of living space, which has been increased with the clearing of Rockblight, and will further expand should the Pudding Court be reclaimed – meanwhile Chipgrin decries the svirfneblin returners as cowards for their ancestors having abandoned the city in its time of need, so why not give them a chance to prove their valor in battle? Senni&nbsp;agrees, asking&nbsp;that if even a kobold can see sense, why not her husband? The two chiefs clasp hands in alliance. Jagh re-iterates that House Center, the old center of government, lies within the Pudding Court's boundaries, and that it should be reclaimed; Yzak wishes that the druid had not spoken hastily, lest the two chiefs each covet the Crown of Schnicktick said to lie within.</p>
<p>Dorbo suggests that the coalition need not destroy every ooze in the enemy host – if an elite force can get to the Pudding King and eliminate him, the oozes should be reduced to their typical mindless and disorganized state. While Dorbo and Chipgrin lead the main forces from the Steadfast Stone as a distraction, the heroes will sneak in from an alternate route and strike at&nbsp;the Pudding King in his throne room. The gnome chieftain calls for his advisers' input: Gurnik Tapfinger says that, thanks to the heroes' cleansing of the Steadfast Stone, banishing of Ogrémoch's Bane, and re-discovery of Entemoch's Boon, the Enclave can bring their earth elementals to battle without fear of corruption, and that his colleague Nomi Pathshutter will put the Boon's summoning circle to use to prepare for battle, trusting in stone as the perfect defense against the oozes. Burrow Warden Jadger, likewise, says that the heroes have been instrumental in putting svirfneblin spirits to rest throughout the city, and that he should be able to rally the other benevolent ghosts to join the battle.</p>
<p>Finally, the alchemist Kazook Pickshine speaks for the Miners' Guild, saying that he can concoct an oil to protect weapons and armor from the oozes' insidious acid corrosion – but he needs a large quantity of ingredients from Neverlight Grove. He also offers to send a large shipment of salt to Gracklstugh to trade for high-quality duergar weapons. The heroes debate for a time whether they have time to traverse the Underdark before battle is joined, with Yzak ultimately talking the Diggermattocks into giving them a writ for magic items in the name of the city's security, including scrolls of Teleportation Circle. The heroes set out at once for Stoneheart Quarry to obtain items from Nomi Pathshutter, with Chief Dorbo dispatching young&nbsp;Trisk Adamantelpiece to Whiteshell Mine to alert them to have the salt shipment prepared. Meanwhile, Quartermaster Senni allots Kazook the reagents he needs to demolish the passage between the Steadfast Stone and the Pudding Court, holding the ooze army at bay.</p>
<p>Checking his psychic sensor, Zimmerl finds the Pudding King – a fairly unremarkable, if shifty-looking, middle-aged deep gnome – reading a book by Lesla Carrowil, a svirfneblin archmage said to have had adventures in strange lands, entitled Magick From Beyond The Mirror.</p>
<p>Day 47 – Ches 5<br>
<span class="caps">SUPPLY</span> <span class="caps">RUN</span>: <span class="caps">QUARRIES</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">MINES</span>&nbsp;<br>
Sparing no time for respite, the heroes leave Blingdenstone (and their followers) behind, reaching Stoneheart Quarry in the dead of night. Nomi Pathshutter honors their writ of acquisition, gifting them the teleportation scrolls and an empty Spell Gem, and having a warlock called Miglin Crackedquartz dispense with the Hex spell in their "full" Spell Gem. Nomi also grants them the teleportation circle rune sequence for Blingdenstone, which will actually deposit them here in the Quarry. Nomi also says that, unfortunately, she gave her last Bag of Holding to a merchant named Ariana, who departed for Gracklstugh some time ago and was expected back by now – the party says that when last they saw her, they were arrested by the Stoneguard.</p>
<p>Continuing on their forced march through the night, the party passes by Pickshine Mines, where they find the entrance guarded by svirfneblin and galeb duhr just as last time, though now Dasco Pickshine is nowhere to be found. Asking the guards, the party finds that no duergar caravan has arrived in several months from the City of Blades, despite Ylsa Henstak of the Gracklstugh Merchant Council saying that a caravan should have left for here some 27 days ago.</p>
<p>At Whiteshell Mine, a salt quarry half a day's travel south of Blingdenstone, the heroes find overseer Perigrog Scrapedust running operations with a fair but demanding hand. Thanks to Trisk's brave courier run, the salt shipment is already loaded in a wagon, with a giant lizard ready to draw it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WERERAT</span> <span class="caps">AMBUSH</span>&nbsp;<br>
Continuing on their sleepless errand, the heroes drive their cave lizard on a midnight run toward the Darklake. As they press forward, Yzak spots five wererats of gnomish stature lying in ambush at a pass. Zimmerl, having been informed, loudly addresses the bandits at a distance, proclaiming that there is now peace between the clans of Blingdenstone, and that the highwaymen should un-string their crossbows and hasten home to join the coming war against the Pudding Court. Unfortunately, his words are not enough to move the wererats' hearts, who offer to allow the party passage only if all but one agree to be magically blinded first, and battle ensues. The heroes crush their opposition; Zap mercifully spares two of the Goldwhiskers even as Yzak and Vesper slay the other three in turn.</p>
<p>Day 51 – Ches 9<br>
<span class="caps">MERROW</span> <span class="caps">MOLESTATION</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having transferred their salt cargo (and their cave lizard) from wagon to keelboat on the Darklake shore the previous day, the party is underway on their fourth subterranean water voyage (toward Neverlight Grove) when something rumbles against their hull from the inky depths: four merrow lash against the boat with tooth and claw. All four of the heroes leap overboard to battle the monstrosities, slaying them all, but not before the keelboat hull is severely damaged. While skirmishing underwater, the group sees several pale sailors' corpses of various Underdark races, lashed to kelp clusters to mark the merrow territory. Finding a small cave, the party plunders the merrows' stolen treasure, finding several ixitxachitl corpses, mute evidence of a bloody squabble between the two races of Demogorgon's aquatic servants.</p>

After Jagh magically mends the damage done to their keelboat's hull by the merrow attack, the crew takes the chance to rest, sans sentry Zimmerl. The drow feels his mind being assaulted, but shrugs it off thanks to his mystical training. Zimmerl rouses the crew, and Yzak flies off on Vesper to scout for the source of this attempted domination. Flying low over the Darklake, the kobold spies the hood of what looks like a huge cobra just beneath the water's surface.<br>
<br>

<p>The spirit naga switches to Lightning Bolts and the Blight spell before it is swarmed by the heroes leaping off the boat into underwater melee – when Jagh grapples it in octopus form, the naga teleports via Dimension Door to safety. Jagh finds it again, and also finds its deadly venomous bite, but soon enough the naga is slain, but its immortal spirit will reform in a new body in a matter of days – doubtless plotting against its vanquishers in its eternal gloom and spite.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DWARVEN</span> <span class="caps">TOMB</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">ZOMBIE</span> <span class="caps">BEHOLDER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Knowing spirit nagas to be brutal tyrants who dwell in dismal ruins amassing arcane treasures, Jagh searches underwater and finds a crumbling stone tomb entrance, which in the Dethek runic alphabet of the dwarves proclaims "Only the dead may walk this path." Yzak reckons the tomb was left here by the shield dwarves of Ammarindar, the same fallen kingdom which left behind the lock &amp; dam the party came upon 37 days prior. Scouting ahead, he swiftly finds a set of stone stairs that lead into an airy tomb. In the central chamber, there are a number of crumbling stone pillars, between which float several gas spores – spherical, balloon-like fungoid life forms bearing an eerie resemblance to eye tyrants with their rhizome growths superficially mimicking a beholder's eyestalks.</p>
<p>After Yzak summons the rest of the party, Zimmerl notices a pair of dead derro tomb robbers with arrows sprouting from their forms lying on the floor deeper into the hall. Zap pokes around, finding pressure plates for an arrow trap, even going so far as to raid the trap's ammunition, finding several "alchemist's arrows", hollowed out to make room for weaponized fluid, specifically a potent liquor!</p>
<p>As Zimmerl and Zap investigate the altar at the end of the hall, Jagh is mending the damaged pillars. As he does so, a beholder zombie lowers itself from a hole in the ceiling, firing disintegrate rays toward the druid. Its paralysis, fear, and disintegration rays fail to destroy any of the party, even when dwarven skeletons rise from tombs in a side passage to push over crumbling pillars in the heroes' direction. The party destroys the undead, with Zimmerl air-walking up the ceiling passage to find a small treasure hoard including Eye-Gouger, a heavy crossbow wielded as a bane of beholders by the dwarf hero Vondal Dankil. The group finds Vondal's sarcophagus as well as several others, some with funerary treasures, elsewhere in the tomb. Vondal's name is vandalized, with crude lettering replacing his own with the then-living beholder's – Glanfluwan the Unparalleled. Seizing upon extant clues, the party surmises that gray dwarf priests of Laduguer had occupied the shield dwarf tomb, and while defending it against the beholder Glanfluwan, defensive wards were activated, first triggering an Earthquake spell, crumbling the tomb around the occupants, and secondly triggering an Animate Dead spell, creating undead from the corpses within. The party returns to the keelboat, guarded by Vesper and their cave lizard, and resumes their voyage.</p>
<p>Day 52 – Ches 10&nbsp;<br>
Smooth sailing on the Darklake as the party continues their breakneck pace toward Neverlight Grove, their thoughts ever dwelling on the perils they seek to prevail over in Blingdenstone.</p>
<p>Day 53 – Ches 11&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">CHASME</span> <span class="caps">MELEE</span>&nbsp;<br>
After round-the-clock sailing on their keelboat, the party again comes upon the hidden coastal grotto where they last stashed their Darklake flotilla, flagged by Jagh with druidic markings.</p>
<p>Retracing their steps toward the myconid haven, the group is making good headway when Zimmerl hears the approach of a horrid droning. The heroes each makes preparations to fight chasme demons in their own idiom, most crucially Yzak casting Silence at the mouth of the tunnel which the buzzing echoes out of. When the five demons – horrific hybrids of man and fly – exit the passage, they are only able to attack with their poisonous proboscises, unable to rely on their drowse-inducing droning. The heroes overcome these hobbled demons with relative ease.<br>

<p>Day 54 – Ches 12<br>
<span class="caps">RETURN</span> TO <span class="caps">NEVERLIGHT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Later, the heroes come upon the main passage to the myconid colony, following a drying underground stream through a tunnel dimly lit by glowing lichen – which sheds light on a large spiderweb sporting the pale, desiccated corpses of several pixies. Coming out, they see the Grove is superficially as they had left it some 29 days ago – a hidden enchanted place, strangely alien but serenely beautiful; an underground marsh suffused with otherworldly light and an abundance of exotic fungi, creating a bizarrely beautiful tapestry of color. The population seems to have drastically decreased, however, with only one myconid circle evident to their eyes – the Builders are on the northern terraces of the central basin, laboring on the foundations of a fungal tower that circle leader Gasbide intends to break through into the surface world.</p>
<p>Bypassing the living palisade of awakened zurkhwoods, Zap sneaks around the southern terraces, avoiding chuul, quaggoth, and hook horror spore servants as he gathers fungal reagents for Kazook Pickshine into the party's Bag of Holding. Meanwhile, Yzak, Zimmerl, and Jagh approach the Builders to distract them. The leader, architect Gasbide, approaches them, but the heroes cover their faces as it spreads its rapport spores. Instead, Zimmerl telepathically contacts the myconid, which informs him that the Lady of Decay has left with the bulk of the Grove to attend her fetid wedding to Araumycos, making sure to gather as many attendees along the way as possible. Only Gasbide and its Builders remain, continuing their sacred and important work toward Sovereign Phylo's vision of a better world. Zimmerl says that he would like the entire circle to gather around to share good news, insisting that they do so now rather than wait for the time of melding that comes after the work day. As the thirty myconids gather, there is a puff of smoke and a flash of flame as a 12-foot tall efreeti with magma-red skin appears from the air, casting a Wall of Flame to incinerate the entire group of fungus folk.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">FIRESTORM</span>&nbsp;<br>
Taken off-guard by the genie's assault, the party sees a squad of twelve duergar, "xarrorn" flame-lancers of Clan Xardelvar, march into the grove, spewing alchemical flame with impunity at anything fungal. Aside from these plate-harnessed warriors, a dozen firenewts – amphibious humanoids from the Elemental Plane of Fire, zealous followers of the evil fire prince Imix – aggressively gallop in on their giant strider mounts to ride down any spore servants which still stand. The efreeti Mamluk al-Çobanli Bey, meanwhile, exhorts his minions to attack in the name of the Everburning Themberchaud, the Father of Flame.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884384/Firenewt_cavalry.jpeg?1532802755"></p>
<p>Mamluk demands the heroes' intentions at the Grove and threatens to enslave them; when they produce the badges issued to them by the Wyrmsmith in an attempt at fostering union, the efreeti proclaims that Yzak is under a writ of outlawry, the kobold's life forfeit for having stolen 8 PP, 9 GP, 11 SP, 11 CP, a garnet, and an oil of sharpness from the dragon's hoard. Combat ensues.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884475/Fire_Elemental.PNG?1532818814"><br>
<br>
The hulking extraplanar slaver's fire wall is smothered by Jagh conjuring a stone wall at its base, and his attempt to retreat within that wall in Gaseous Form is stymied by the party's blows. His xarrorn and firenewts are too far to aid him, even as Zap invisibly dashes across the basin to join the fight. Only a single fire elemental is present to protect its master, and is able to burn the heroes by the furnace-like heat of its mere presence. Even this achieves little more than a surface charring of Zap and Jagh, and when Mamluk dies, his body of bronze and basalt disappears into a flash of fire and puff of smoke, leaving his falchion clattering to the ground along with his jewel-encrusted torcs, chains, and rings.</p>
<p><span class="caps">POST</span>-<span class="caps">FIGHT</span> <span class="caps">PALAVER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Shocked at seeing their elemental master slain, the duergar and firenewts cease their onslaught for a moment, looking upon the heroes. Zimmerl addresses the xarrorn in Undercommon, telling them to submit or die. The squad's sergeant Ular Xardelvar raises his helm's visor, saying that here, beyond the Deepkingdom's frontiers, he feels he may speak his mind without Themberchaud's spies watching. Ular begins by informing the heroes of the immediate aftermath of their telling Themberchaud of the treachery of the Keepers of the Flame thirty-four days ago: after half a day's siege of the Hold of the Deepking (and a mighty rampage for the dragon to vent his fury, unable to make Yzak pay for his theft), Horgar V's consort Shal emerged, treating with Themberchaud on the battlements. No one knows what deal she made, but ever since then the Deepking has been on house arrest in his own keep, with Themberchaud keeping the Stoneguard officers and other advisers as choice morsels. The Keepers have been supplanted by the Gray Ghosts, the dragon surrounding himself with these thieves, slaves, and derro as duergar society has turned upside down. The dragon has arrogantly funneled the industry of the entire City of Blades toward his lair – the great city's works now serve only the Wyrmsmith, as he demands more and more tribute for his hoard rather than allow the Merchants Council to conduct foreign commerce. Meanwhile, the wyrm had sent the efreeti, one of his many elemental minions, to lead a raid on Neverlight Grove, having heard of some kind of infectious spore there and decided to accept no risks to the Deepkingdom.</p>
<p>When asked to make contact with one of the discontent leaders, Ular does not hide his fear, saying he would no doubt be sniffed out by one of the dragon's Darkhaft spies, whom he uses to keep an eye on the lairds and the merchants. The sergeant does say that he knows the head of the Merchant Council, Durna Thuldark (metalworker &amp; jewelmonger), to be of the anti-Themberchaud party, and she would respond favorably if brought the efreeti's falchion as proof of their prowess and intent.</p>
<p>Having heard this, Yzak (wielding the gnomish axe that lets him speak Primordial) asks the firenewts if they will join a rebellion against the Wyrmsmith. When they spur their giant striders, fleeing the Grove, Zimmerl blasts them, killing half the squadron and all of their mounts. The duergar grimly lower their visors and dispatch their erstwhile comrades. Yzak, seeing one xarrorn who fell against a chuul spore servant in the earlier skirmish, takes the fire-lance for his own.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Grove, which now smolders in alchemical flame, the party (minus Zap, who refuses) revisits Yggmorgus, the titanic mushroom tower on the mist-shrouded eastern plateau. True to Gasbide's claim, Zuggtmoy and her entourage have absconded, a few bits of her gown's train of lichen the only mute evidence of her former presence. Amid the pits of fungal muck walks a single Bridesmaid of Zuggtmoy. "She" invites the heroes to hasten toward the heart of Araumycos to catch up to the Lady of Decay – Zimmerl responds by blasting her to pieces. The party sets out for Gracklstugh with the gray dwarves of Clan Xardelvar, determined to get the weapons needed for the coming clash against the Pudding King, and perhaps to poke the dragon in the eye as well.</p>

<span class="caps">SEPARATE</span> <span class="caps">WAYS</span>&nbsp;<br>
After trekking from the cremated ruin of Neverlight Grove to their secret boat grotto, the heroes find their 11 duergar xarrorn companions too many for their single salt-laden keelboat. The sergeant, Ular Xardelvar, orders his men to spend a day fashioning rafts from zurkhwood mushroom caps and follow in their wake as he joins the party, sharing in watch duty at the tiller.</p>
<p>Day 56 – Ches 14<br>
<span class="caps">INSANE</span> <span class="caps">DUERGAR</span> <span class="caps">PIRATE</span><br>
While navigating "stone teeth" plaguing the bed of a steeply-inclined stream, the crew hears Dwarvish voices echoing from a side tunnel, out of which spills another keelboat. The cackling, wild-eyed gray dwarf at the helm is a Darklake pirate who Zap recognizes as one Helmut Clawbane. Helmut's crew pleads for him to stop as he steers their boat toward the stalagmites jutting from the water, and when the mad captain throws his first mate overboard Jagh transforms into octopus form, rescuing the duergar and planting him back aboard the duergar boat. Meanwhile Zimmerl has positioned a telekinetic barrier between the heroes' boat and danger, and Yzak has rammed their boat into the duergar one, forcing palaver as they straddle the stalagmites.</p>
<p>The crew, calling for Helmut's death as he is unfit to sail or to live, are tempered by the first mate, Halfdan, who calls instead to maroon him here at Stone-Tooth Strait. Jagh keeps this crew together by magically restoring Helmut's mind. Suddenly sane, Helmut confirms what Halfdan says about how he gained his madness – these duergar recently saw the Prince of Demons, Demogorgon, within a day's sail of Gracklstugh. Jagh avails himself of some fresh water and Darklake Stout from the ship's hold, but despite rudely asking Halfdan what treasures might lie within the locked strongbox, does not attempt to rob the pirates. The two boats part ways.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FLOODED</span> <span class="caps">TUNNEL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Several hours later, the heroes find that the watery passage they are following comes to an end – and yet not a dead one. Yzak sensing that the current continues, and that the cavern ceiling has simply dipped below the water for a stretch, Jagh shifts into constrictor form, scouting ahead. Finding the tunnel not overlong, Jagh returns and casts Control Water, lowering the water level so that the boat can pass through. While traversing its length, the party is attacked from above by an ooze creature dropping from the ceiling. The monster – a "slithering tracker", a vengeance-obsessed stealthy assassin devoted to Juiblex – slinks free of their superior numbers after its initial ambush, crawling to the bottom of the hull.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884386/Slithering_Tracker.PNG?1532803281"><br>
<br>
Luckily Jagh was not hit, lest he lose concentration on Control Water and the tunnel flood, their precious salt cargo lost as it dissolved into the onyx water. Jagh wills the waters to completely part, and the boat squashes the ooze against the bed of the Darklake – also smashing the keel for which it is named. Jagh keeps his concentration up on his water magic as he casts Mending spells to restore the boat, with Zap meanwhile using the Stonespeaker Crystal to speak with the dead slithering tracker. It claims that Juiblex sent it to attack the heroes here to prevent their mission to arm the svirfneblin against his agent the Pudding King; the heroes respond that they are still trying to forge a pact with the Faceless Lord against Zuggtmoy.</p>
<p>Back in Blingdenstone, Zap's conjured earth elemental expires, its watch against the Pudding Court ended.</p>

<span class="caps">TOWARD</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DRAGON</span>'S <span class="caps">LAIR</span>&nbsp;<br>
In the wee hours, the party's boat is passing through a vast cavern, when they spot a small island dominated by a charred and deeply cracked keep of duergar design. Finding the outbuildings burned to the ground, along with two dozen charred skeletons and claw gouges in the keep's flagstones, the party quickly connects this with Ular's tale of Themberchaud having rampaged to vent his wrath after being unable to catch Yzak for his thieving.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884387/Darklake.PNG?1532803322"></p>
<p>After poking at the bones and stones, the party is walking back toward their boat when a virtual curtain of debris seems to head their way, falling from the ceiling high above as a tremor rumbles through the cavern. The damaged keep shears in half, the top portion sliding toward them and badly battering the heroes with plummeting masonry.</p>
<p>At midday, the embattled keelboat passes under a low stone overhang, emerging into the vast cavern that houses Gracklstugh. The waters of the Darklake for a mile from the city's docks are tainted, having become sulfurous as Themberchaud has claimed the city as his lair – tremors also being such a sign, as well as portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Dead fish and stranger things float belly-up as the land itself is corrupted by the dragon's presence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Darklake Docks have nary a berth open as the entire duergar merchant fleet&nbsp;sits in port, matching with Ular's description of Themberchaud stifling trade as he turns the city's production toward his fattening hoard.</p>
<p>The heroes elect to approach the City of Blades via the secret shore shown to them by the derro serial killer Buppido and the duergar "arms dealer" (spy for the Deepking) Hemeth when last they arrived here some 40 days prior. They land innocuously at the isolated cove, hoping the eye of the dragon is not yet upon them.</p>

<p>Day 57 – Ches 15 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">TRAPPED</span> <span class="caps">TUNNEL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Hopping from the boat deck down to the pebbly northern shore of Gracklstugh, Zimmerl leaves a psionic sensor on the keelboat and the heroes turn toward a hidden tunnel not far from the "smuggler's cove" that they know leads directly to the Gray Ghost hideout in the Whorlstone Tunnels beneath the city. The xarrorn sergeant Ular Xardelvar asks where they're going – his clan's holdings straddle Laduguer's Furrow, the ravine dividing the city. The party does not explain, telling him to keep pace at a safe distance.</p>
<p>Going down the long and twisting tunnel, the party hears a loud clicking sound as mechanisms set into place. As whirling blades emerge from the stone all around them, the party at first tries to cautiously send Zap to disarm the many blades from a distance, but comes to realize this is a more devious and complex trap, requiring the burglar to be within the area of effect to do his work. Meanwhile, Jagh – who initially doubts that it is a trap at all – barrels ahead in giant scorpion form, finding the cracked and debris-strewn stone further in to be tough going. Making his way through this, the druid is continually battered by falling pillars. Zap, after eventually disarming the whirling blades, bypasses the difficult terrain astride Vesper, finding that the final stretch of the passage leading to the trapdoor down is warded by a Rune of Fear, meant to drive intruders back into the falling pillars. Zimmerl, cautiously in the rear, uses his air mastery to fly toward the rune and aid Zap in disarming it. The rune only becomes more potent as they tamper with it, and despite Jagh and Vesper acting on defensive duty to catch fleeing party members, there is still some havoc wrought by the rune before Zimmerl applies his mastery of arcana enough to disarm the trap fully. Yzak ignites Dawnbringer and carves out the bare rock where once the rune stood, putting it in the Bag of Holding, in case of…something.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884400/BladeTrap.jpg?1532807766"></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GRAY</span> <span class="caps">GHOST</span> <span class="caps">SAFEHOUSE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Slinking down the 60-foot iron ladder beneath the unlocked trapdoor, Zap finds the peephole, at dwarven eye-level, to be closed. Clambering with his Mage Hand, the gnome opens the door and peers in, seeing another of his race! Tinkering around in the hideout's alchemy lab is the deep gnome merchant Ariana, whom the party last saw when she sold Zap some gemstones in the Blade Bazaar, immediately before they were arrested by the Stoneguard. Zimmerl descends the ladder and telepathically contacts Ariana, asking her the current situation: she says that she was arrested for selling Zap those illicit gemstones, and was enslaved in Overlake Hold. Escaping in the chaos when Themberchaud attacked the Hold after the party passed information to the dragon about his psionic priests, the Keepers of the Flame, plotting to replace him with a more pliable wyrmsmith, fleeing to the Tunnels and falling in with the Gray Ghosts.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884402/Derro.PNG?1532807804"></p>
<p>Ariana confirms what Ular has told them of Gracklstugh under Themberchaud's thumb – that the Father of Flames has inverted duergar society, and that the Gray Ghosts who had been opposed to the Keepers are now among his chief advisers, so that the derro, calassabraks (duergar outcasts from society), and even the odd escaped slave who compose this thieves' guild are now trusted officers of the crown. With the Stoneguard decimated and the Keepers reduced to mere sycophancy, crime is rampant. Madness continues to spread. The duergar Merchant Council and Council of Lairds are kept in line via assassins and spies, in addition to the sorcery and manipulation of the derro Council of Savants. Themberchaud rules through sheer fear and power, governing in the Deepking's name, keeping Horgar V shut up in his hold "to protect him from evil counsel." No one has seen the Deepking since Themberchaud asserted control, when Horgar's consort Shal appeared on the royal keep's battlements to treat with the dragon, granting unknown terms. Meanwhile, the Deepking loyalist Stonespeaker Hgraam has quit the city with his Cairngorm Clan of stone giants, gone to parts unknown. Chaos has supplanted law in the City of Blades. Ariana says that the Ghosts are led by three derro – Uskvil and his mates, the twin sisters Aliinka and Zubriska. Aliinka, in fact, is in the safehouse even now.</p>
<p>Ariana had resigned herself to this unwilling service to the Gray Ghosts, but when the heroes offer to return her to Blingdenstone, her plucky gnome nature resurfaces. As the other heroes lower themselves down, Jagh (still in giant scorpion form) clambers noisily down, so Ariana causes a distraction by throwing volatile salts and minerals together in a hot pan on the alchemy stove. One of the duergar thugs present comes to oversee her, berating her for not knowing her job. While he is distracted, Zimmerl telekinetically lifts the zurkhwood beam barring the door and hurls it at him, launching the party's assault. The gray dwarf is quickly brought down.</p>
<p>The heroes spill out of the Ghosts' alchemy lab toward the fungal gardening area, Ariana plodding behind them with acid flasks in hand. The other duergar guards and Aliinka have hidden among supply crates. One, invisible, uses the manure spreader to spray treated rothé waste at the heroes, manifesting a Stinking Cloud. Other than wounded dignity, the heroes suffer little dealing with these calassabraks, the cleansing light of Dawnbringer blinding these foes. Even Aliinka, a master thief, is unable to manage a sneak attack from hiding with her crossbow thanks to her derro eyes. After Zimmerl arrives, his excellent sight spots Aliinka, and he is able to compel her to believe that the manure spreader contains a wonderful elixir of power. Laughing at their foolishness, the derro dashes to the copper tank, and begins guzzling manure. As she retches and reels, her body realizing her peril even if her mind does not, Zap finishes off his fellow rogue.</p>
<p>As the heroes loot the area and plan their next move, Zap finds several potions, and an alchemist's note on their miscibility. In addition, there is a ceramic 1-gallon jug that, though empty, weighs 12 pounds, and makes a sloshing sound when moved. It is an Alchemy Jug, which can create a variety of liquids, from salt water to wine, or from poison to mayonnaise. Bronze Dwarvish runes around the rim state: "Crafted by Brilmara of Clan Muzgardt in Alturiak of the Year 1487, to commemmorate Themberchaud the Wyrmsmith's Sharing His Wise Counsel With The Deepking In Addition To His Mighty Works". Brilmara is the larcenous maid from the Gohlbrorn's Lair whose life the party traded her uncle Murghol for a cask of Darklake Stout. In very un-duergar fashion, there are inset rubies and gold filigree, depicting Themberchaud resting atop a stalagmite keep.</p>
<p>Having regained their old hideout from which they launched the coup which put Themberchaud in power, the heroes now plot their next move.</p>

<p>In which ethereal explorations are launched via the Whorlstone Tunnels' mysterious obelisk. Two derro are dealt with in very different ways – Y of the Society of Brilliance is pre-emptively slain and then revivified, while the homicidal Buppido is once again left to continue his killing spree.</p>
<p>Day 57 – Ches 15 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">FOUNTAIN</span> OF (<span class="caps">LESSER</span>) <span class="caps">EVIL</span>&nbsp;<br>
After some abortive dabbling in alchemy at the Gray Ghost lab and pillaging the fungal garden pit, the group sets out for the obelisk which the derro Demogorgon cult had sought to utilize. As the heroes pass near the foul pool where they once battled a water weird, Zimmerl's magic-enhanced elven senses pick up impish laughter from the chamber. Zap sneaks down and sees a quasit cavorting in the putrid waters. Glamering himself to appear as a quasit himself, Zap splashes around with the true quasit for a bit before the demon suggests they shapechange into bat form and go poo on the head of a "new derro" who has recently been seen snooping around the obelisk. Zap submerges himself and sends up a phantasmal bat, seemingly joining the quasit on its errand of mischief. Returning to the party in demon guise, the gnome is crestfallen none of his fellows find mirth in his trickery. He does tell them that the quasit revealed that Buppido is still haunting the Tunnels.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FUNGUS</span> <span class="caps">FOLK</span> &amp; <span class="caps">MOLD</span> <span class="caps">MEN</span>&nbsp;<br>
Nearing the fungus-ridden doorway toward the obelisk, Zap is scouting ahead when he spies a Chamberlain of Zuggtmoy, escorted by four duergar spore servants as it treats with a vegepygmy chief and its band. (Vegepygmies are a race of mold men who rise from corpses slain by russet mold, itself thought to originate in a strange metal dungeon which appeared in a distant mountain range after a falling star was seen in the sky). Zap goes back to report telepathically to Zimmerl, but by the time he returns the Chamberlain has spread infestation spores and corrupted one of the vegepygmies. Zimmerl, after being convinced by Zap not simply to exterminate all of these fungal life-forms, contacts the vegepygmy chief, whose name is Yeaf. The mystic informs Chief Yeaf that he is an agent of mighty Araumycos, who does not wish to wed Zuggtmoy as the Chamberlain claimed! What's more, his man has been ensorceled by mind magic! The chief, having none of this, lowers his spear and leads the charge toward Zuggtmoy's minions.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884403/Vegepygmy.PNG?1532808076"></p>
<p>Yzak is close behind, igniting Dawnbringer and laying about with the intelligent sunblade, its light destroying several nearby patches of russet mold even as its radiant blade cuts down the spore servants with alacrity. Vegepygmy fights vegepygmy, swiping at each other with their claws as their natural regeneration keeps them in the fight. The Chamberlain spends much of the skirmish rolling about on the floor wracked by Tasha's Hideous Laughter, deep laughter booming from behind its mossy cowl. Chief Yeaf deals the mortal blow to the Chamberlain, though his "aid" is more detrimental, as he undid Zap's magic with his spear-strikes, and likewise released a poisonous spore-cloud. After sharing this victory, the vegepygmies go their separate way, Yeaf swearing to spread the word to his people that Zuggtmoy's promise of bountiful rot to be an empty and self-serving one.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WHY</span>, Y?&nbsp;<br>
Finally approaching the obelisk chamber, the heroes once again send Zap to scout ahead. Still disguised as a quasit, the rogue soon finds a derro in contemplation at the 50-foot obelisk's base, with a gazer hovering over his shoulder (a tiny, five-eyed beholderkin, the fragment of a true eye tyrant's dreams). Zap sneaks up on the derro, who addresses him in multiple languages before they decide to converse in Abyssal. After repeatedly trying to coax him into revealing his "evil schemes", Zap is banished into a Maze by the exasperated diviner. The true quasit, in bat form, shits on the derro's head.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884405/Gazer.PNG?1532808511"></p>
<p>The other party members are poised to assault. Zimmerl psychically blasts the gazer, splattering the familiar as its brain explodes. Jagh, in giant scorpion form, grips the derro in his claw as Yzak dives in on bat-back and puts a Silence spell on the caster. The kobold goes on to slaughter the derro despite reading his lips and recognizing the phrase "I remember you," which they have repeatedly heard from the Society of Brilliance, as well as from Stonespeaker Hgraam, in their recurring encounters with an apparently disrupted timestream. Zap returns from the maze demiplane with the derro's concentration broken and asks what he missed. Realizing whom they have killed, Zimmerl mystically restores the derro to life.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ILLITHID</span> <span class="caps">EXPOSITION</span>&nbsp;<br>
Sputtering back to life, the derro reveals that his name is Y, and that he is indeed a member of the Society of Brilliance, here to study the faerzress-infused Tunnels. He asks where "Blurg" and "Skriss" are, whom the party does not know, and soon establishes when they are. Y admits that his race is fundamentally a twisted and benighted one, and that he himself is insane, but his madness is relatively benign, manifesting in an obsession with secrets. Y has accepted his madness, realizing that his race was not created by their gods – the Great Savant, Diirinka and his betrayed brother, the Mad God Diinkarazan – whose pathetic tales the savants have repeated and embellished for millennia, but by the cruel experiments of the mind flayers. Zap shows some interest in joining the Society, being of requisite intellect and showing interest in chronomancy, and Y says he will have to relay the petition to Grazilaxx – a mind flayer whom he, paradoxically, is willing to follow. When queried on where he met the heroes in his past, Y says they will come to the library of Gravenhollow – though, relying on teleportation as he does, he does not know how to give them geographic directions there.</p>
<p>Asked what metal he believes the eldritch obelisk to be crafted from, Y goes into a tirade about illithidkind: the alien metal, he believes, is "substare", an unbreachable alloy unknown to Faerûnian science. Y claims that substare was used to construct Penumbra, an unbelievably vast disc-world built by the blood and toil of a thousand generations of thralls. Penumbra, Y says, is a disc-world whose far edges lie as from the star it encircles as Toril lies from the sun. This mighty work proves that there is no greater evil than the illithids – even the implacable foes in the eternal Blood War, demons and devils, considered a truce to deal with the upstart mind flayers. Asked how the illithids could have achieved such a thing, Y says that none can say, since none of his research has been able to determine when the aberrations appeared in Toril's timeline. Zimmerl objects, saying that the gith forerunners rebelled and toppled the illithid empire, but Y simply laughs, saying that this is "a fine fairy&nbsp;tale", and that no thrall race could rise against such lords. Zimmerl also reveals that he learned the Invisible Art under illithid tutelage, and Y calls him a fool if he believes a mind flayer has shown him kindness, accusing the drow of being an illithid pawn, if not a willing agent. When the heroes begin to question his views and chafe at his lack of social niceties, suggesting he might be better off without "inferior intellects" around, Y simply agrees and teleports away, leaving the heroes to meet him again in their futures.</p>

<br>
With Y gone (and his gazer destroyed), the party elects to investigate the obelisk from beyond time and space. Jagh is the first to touch it – and falls dead! As the party investigates his "corpse", the druid's soul is in fact hurled to the Ethereal Plane, where he experiences several visions amid the swirling sea of colored mist, through which he sees the Material Plane as a blurred vision of itself. Jagh sees an impenetrable maze, with bloody fangs and horns rending fur and flesh as hunter battles hunter in a savage duel to the death, inhuman cackles mixing with the din of battle (the druid recognizes this as clashing gnolls and minotaurs). He sees a hidden underground encampment, furtive denizens skulking, casting suspicious glances at potential thieves, with greed in their hearts. He sees a vision of fertile soil, supporting a vast array of fungus in the richness of its rot – and all this absorbed by a wave of caustic slime. This, of course, represents the centuries-old conflict of Zuggtmoy and Juiblex for the stinking Abyssal realm of Shedaklah. Finally, Jagh sees a great horned figure moving amongst a subterranean alien cityscape. His vision is overtaken by the image of a skull, suddenly gripped by mauve-colored tentacles, throwing him from his reverie. Seeing a hungry phase spider lying in ambush above him, Jagh reaches out the obelisk once again and shifts back to the Material Plane, his spirit returning to his body.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BUPPIDO</span> "<span class="caps">LIVES</span>"!!!&nbsp;<br>
Returning to the Material Plane through sheer force of personality, Jagh describes these things to his comrades. Ultimately, Yzak decides to accompany Jagh back to the Ethereal Plane, utilizing the obelisk's multiversal connections to find more charismatic (in Jagh's case) or more robust (in Yzak's) versions of themselves. There, the druid and ranger meet their old companion Buppido, who is busy slaughtering the Gray Ghost alchemist who had succumbed to his own experiments, having been cast indefinitely onto this spectral plane by a permanent Oil of Etherealness. Buppido bears them no ill will for his three prior defeats during their last jaunt in the Whorlstone Tunnels, instead praising them for launching the chain of events that led to the present state of derro shadow dominance at Themberchaud's back, which began when the Wyrmsmith's rage was unleashed upon the Deepking and Keepers of the Flame after the heroes revealed the Keepers' treacherous plan to replace the dragon. Buppido offers them hospitality in his lair, and eventually most of the heroes follow him ethereally, while Zimmerl and Vesper stand sentry over their somnolent bodies. The ever-genial derro serial killer shows off the still-imprisoned cave bears which Jagh thought he had freed by informing Stonespeaker Hgraam of their presence. Clan Cairngorm is conspicuously absent from the new Gracklstugh order, but Hgraam's apprentice Rihuud (the stone giant who, mad and two-headed, the party stopped rampaging through the Darklake District before helping Hgraam cure him) is present. Bypassing magma and steam mephits frolicking in the diseased pool, now sulfurous and bubbling, the heroes come to Buppido's lair, where their Buppido displays a flesh golem. This monstrosity has spontaneously risen from the lingering necromantic energies here, raising the corpses of duergar, goblin, grimlock, and other murder victims in a parody of life.</p>
<p>Several times, the heroes ask their former comrade to help them overthrow Themberchaud, but the derro ghost simply has no interest in overturning the current power paradigm – indeed, he asks if the heroes would be interested in helping him assassinate the pro-Deepking members of the duergar Council of Lairds, helping to consolidate Themberchaud's rule. Buppido claims he has been eavesdropping in the Hall of Sacred Spells, the headquarters of the derro Council of Savants, and has heard which lairds have yet to fall under the sway of their bribes, threats, and enchantments. Furthermore, Buppido claims to be using his ghostly possession ability to make Deepking Horgar V his puppet. Ultimately the heroes refuse Buppido's request just as he did theirs, but the ghost says that he is in no particular hurry. Shifting into the Material Plane, he continues his carved shrine of a tall, guant derro with a staring, insane face dominated by red eyes with black pupils and crowned with streaming, multicolored hair. This is Diinkarazan, the derro deity whom Buppido believes himself an avatar of.</p>
<p>As Yzak, Zap, and Jagh journey back across the Tunnels,&nbsp;Vesper and the mentally-fatigued Zimmerl slay the lingering phase spider as it tries to drain the life from their physical husks, wounding Jagh's inert form nearly mortally.</p>

After a long rest, the heroes are almost ready to make their way up to Gracklstugh proper to make the salt trade for weapons to aid Blingdenstone. On the way, they are attacked by hezrou demons, stinking toad-like foot soldiers of the Abyss which burst forth from the seemingly-bottomless Fountain of Evil. After a short rest, they return to the former cultist pens, and easily kill the lone derro guard, dozing as his cookpot bubbles over its noxious contents of fungus and vermin. Jagh sets the cave bears free, again fulfilling his druidic oaths to these beleaguered beasts.<br>

<p>In which the heroes cross paths with the Empty-Scabbard Killers, infiltrated by the illithid Qualux, and learn of their many contracts from Deepking Horgar V.</p>
<p>Day 57 – Ches 15 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">OBELISK</span> &amp; <span class="caps">PALAVER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Still in the Whorlstone Tunnels, there is some usage of the mysterious obelisk (mixing some potions and swapping Jagh with an alternate universe counterpart who had thereby gained permanent fire breath). Next, the heroes debate whether they should launch some sort of revolt against Themberchaud beginning with Clan Xardelvar, whether they should re-explore the rest of the Tunnels (perhaps utilizing the Demogorgon cult's two-head rituals), and other such things. Ultimately, Zap convinces them that making good on their stated goal of trading salt for weapons should be their next objective. Disguising them as slaves of the drow Zimmerl (Jagh as his "natural" wood elf form; Yzak and Zap as svirfneblin), Zap leads on.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FINDING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FORAK</span>-<span class="caps">ERACH</span>-<span class="caps">NAEK</span><br>
Hearing Dwarvish voices ahead as the heroes approach the alchemist lab, Zimmerl goes ahead alone, scouting with the aid of an Invisbility spell from Zap. There the mystic sees a stout duergar with an eyepatch ordering two others about as they case the lab. Then, a strange creature Zimmerl recognizes as a mindwitness – an aberration begotten when a&nbsp;beholder&nbsp;has been subjected to illithid ceremorphosis – float into the room, as the duergar speak of carrying out their orders for someone named Qualux. The eyepatch-wearing duergar bears a shield which features an eyeball at its center.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884410/Mindwitness.PNG?1532809438"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zimmerl telepathically contacts the mindwitness and speaks to it at some length, determining that these duergar are members of the legendary Forak-Erach-Naek, or "Empty-Scabbard Killers" in an obscure Dwarvish dialect – the same psionic assassins-for-hire whom the party witnessed murdering Werz Saltbaron exactly forty days prior.</p>
<p>After determining the order has no contract on his own head, Zimmerl retrieves the rest of the heroes, Ular, and Ariana. As they head through the lab toward the ladder to the exit tunnel, a tall, mauve-skinned being with four tentacles dangling from its mouth stands in the doorway – a mind flayer. This, the heroes learn is Qualux – not the mindwitness.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884411/Mind_Flayer2.jpg?1532809688"><br>
<br>
Qualux is interested if the heroes have seen a fugitive kobold named Yzak, but is fooled by Zap's disguises, and his Detect Thoughts fails to pry the secret from their minds. It does reveal how to arrange contracts with the Killers should the party ever wish to procure the order's services, and denies their request to eliminate Themberchaud. The heroes nearly blow their cover as the illithid notices that it can read the "svirfneblin" Yzak's mind, but not Zap's (who has learned his racial magic, and thus has Nondetection), but Zap plays this off as his own mastery.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BATTLE</span> <span class="caps">AFTER</span> <span class="caps">ALL</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the heroes file by to ascend the ladder to the Darklake District, Yzak goes to draw Dawnbringer, triggering Qualux, who warns his assassin minions via the telepathic hub that is a mindwitness. Qualux briefly dominates Yzak, but his concentration is broken before he can have the ranger destroy anyone with his Sun Blade. Zap holds the rear against the duergar soulblades, whose divination buffs (True Strike, Hunter's Mark) are useless against his Nondetection. Jagh casts a circular Wall of Fire against Qualux's minions, whittling away at the duergar. The mindwitness blasts the heroes with a variety of eye rays, most effectively when it telekinetically places Yzak in the Wall of Fire after he is stunned by a mind blast from Qualux. Unprotected by his thralls, however, Qualux is quickly cut down by Zap, and his thralls fall in turn.</p>
<p><span class="caps">INVESTIGATION</span>&nbsp;<br>
Finding the gear of Qualux's second, Eldgrim (the eyepatch-wearer) is crafted to attune specifically to mind flayer thralls (though he does bear a pack filled with disguises useful for moving among any quarter of duergar society), the heroes move on to Qualux's own corpse. Zimmerl finds a small stone orb with the royal seal of Clan Steelshadow engraved into it. Sensing its psionic imprint, he experiences a vision at the foot of Deepking Horgar's throne, from the perspective of Eldgrim, Qualux's proxy in all matters in the city. Enthroned beside Horgar is his surprisingly comely consort, Shal, bedecked in a gown glittering in gems. The gray dwarf monarch shrieks down his edicts as he feverishly writes a list of names:</p>
<p>“Faster this time. Faster! I want to hear heads rolling by the<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Deepking goes on at some length beyond these lairds, naming dozens of other duergar and derro with only one or two words of description, most of which are petty insults ("ugly", "poor", "wretched", "commoner", etc.) With others, Horgar notes how they smelled odd, how they looked at his royal personage wrongly one day, or how Horgar just knows they are up to something.</p>
<p>Ular is amazed by this revelation, but contrary to the heroes' expectation that he would turn upon the mad monarch, he believes that some of the lairds would rally behind Horgar if he publicly made himself a figurehead against Themberchaud. Zap uses the Stonespeaker Crystal to cast Speak With Dead on Qualux, confirming everything of import Zimmerl had learned, as well as the location of the Cave of Twelve Teeth where the Empty-Scabbard Killers have their base, east of the city near the Darklake shore. The dead illithid also reveals that the Deepking is indeed insane; specifically that he believes himself to be constantly hunted and watched by powerful enemies. Qualux had only recently arrived in Gracklstugh to infiltrate the assassins' order, and unanswered questions remain: why did it react poorly to Zimmerl saying that he underwent his mystical training in the illithid city of Cyrog? Were there other motives of Qualux behind seizing control of an assassins' guild aside from profit? Did it truly intend to assassinate the Wyrmsmith? These questions' answers may be lost, but perhaps they still lie somewhere in the City of Blades.</p>

<p>In which the seeds for civil war in Gracklstugh are sown, and the heroes return to Blingdenstone with their hard-won cargo of arms.</p>
<p>Day 57 – Ches 15 (cont.)<br>
<span class="caps">ASSASSINS</span>!&nbsp;<br>
With Zap disguising Zimmerl as the illithid Qualux and Yzak as his second, the soulblade Eldgrim, the heroes leave the Whorlstone Tunnels behind. Heading to the Cave of Twelve Teeth just east of Gracklstugh, Zimmerl detects a pair of duergar sentries. Calling out to them telepathically, the psionicist commands them to bring the heroes to the Empty-Scabbard Killers' hidden headquarters.</p>
<p>Their disguises fooling the psionic assassins, "Qualux" and "Eldgrim" command those present to assemble the entire order. Within a few hours, all fifty Killers are gathered, a group largely consisting of calassabraks – those outcast from duergar society. Zimmerl divides them into two companies. The first group he orders to eliminate the Deepking's ministers and retainers, and, if possible, Horgar himself. One of the assassins in this group dares to question "Qualux's" orders, powering through mental domination to point out that Horgar has given them a lucrative list of contracts. But Zimmerl's charisma wins out over this gray dwarf's, and the soulblades are sent on their bloody business. The second group is ordered to kill Themberchaud's loyalists (the Gray Ghosts, the Keepers of the Flame, and the derro Council of Savants), perhaps even the Wyrmsmith himself, and offers no resistance.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">BLADE</span> <span class="caps">BAZAAR</span>: <span class="caps">SALT</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">ARMS</span>&nbsp;<br>
While waiting for the inevitable civil war, the heroes decide to carry out their stated mission in the City of Blades – to wit, the acquisition of weaponry to arm the gnomes and wererats of Blingdenstone against the oozes of the Pudding King. Retrieving their keelboat, the row to the Darklake Docks, with Zap changing Zimmerl's disguise to that of an anonymous drow noble. As they moor at the docks, the longshoremen ask where to unload their sizable salt payload, expectantly holding out their hand for a tip.</p>
<p>As the heroes decide whom to deliver the salt to, another merchant butts in, hawking his "fireweed" – a plant that converts heat into food for itself, and foul toxins into breathable air, rendering lifeless tunnels relatively fertile. This is especially valuable in modern Gracklstugh, with the many geysers, bubbling mud pits with cavorting mephits, and other sources of heat added to the old forges and smelters since Themberchaud assumed his reign. The party decides to buy out his stock. A smoldering brazier now dominates the bazaar, its sinister light glaring against a crude idol to Themberchaud.</p>
<p>As they cross the Blade Bazaar to this merchant's stall, the heroes note many more derro here than during their last visit, indicating the mad race's ascendance along with Themberchaud. More bracing, however, is an illusory "wanted poster" of Yzak. A three-dimensional, life-sized glamour of the black-scaled kobold, wearing Droki's displacer beast hat, is clearly displayed in the market, with a list of his goods stolen from the dragon's hoard detailed in several common Underdark scripts, along with a promise of a rich reward from the Deepking's vaults. Yzak, still disguised as the duergar Eldgrim, takes a moment to admire the illusion.</p>
<p>Ultimately deciding to bring Blingdenstone's salt to their old pal Werz Saltbaron, the heroes follow the duergar porters to the Clan Saltbaron office in the Blade Bazaar, finding Werz just as fooled by their disguises as anyone else. He offers to either buy the salt from them outright, or to act as broker to trade the goods for another clan's product. The party decides on the latter; specifically for arms and armor. Thus, Werz sets off to negotiate with either Clan Ironhead or the royal Clan Steelshadow. He is confident he can get a good deal, since with trade stifled there is much more supply and much less demand than would otherwise be so. Before they leave, Werz asks and receives permission from Zimmerl to strike the surface elf slave Jagh for his impertinent questioning.</p>
<p>Back in the Bazaar, the heroes do a bit of shopping as they await Werz's mercantile errand. Yzak, seeking some barding for Vesper, offhandedly says to one of the merchants that it is the bat who is the master. Zimmerl joins in, telepathically contacting the merchant, convincing him that it is Vesper's mental contact. Having prepared a saddle for a bat-like Lowerdark race called the desmodu (but with no customers given Themberchaud's blockade), the merchant is very willing to unload this Saddle of the Kavalrachni, going along with Vesper/Zimmerl's demand for barding and an extra saddle-seat.</p>
<p>Heading down below into the Gholbrorn's Lair common room, the group talks to the one-handed innkeeper Murghol Muzgardt. Forty days since their last arrival here, it is now early spring, and the inn is noticeably flooding with Darklake runoff. Jagh, now acting like a loyal and capable slave, applies some Mending cantrips to weak spots in the walls; Murghol is amazed by the elf's affinity for stone.</p>
<p>Having earned a discount on their room, the party sits at a corner table to plot their next move. A wild-eyed derro street preacher interrupts their palaver, dashing up to them, gesticulating wildly, and screaming that "The time for battle is nigh! With the mighty Father of Flames leading our vanguard, how can our army fail? The last Uniting War, the one to<br>
purify our race and propel us to everlasting glory and domination, has come!" Yzak stand up, ignites Dawnbringer, and decapitates the degenerate dwarf. As the light fades, blinding to a dweller of the Lightless Lands, Yzak explains to Murghol that he doesn't know what happened. Murghol doesn't care, simply telling them to dispose of the corpse. Times have been hard for his business, since the royal consort Shal has recently begun advertising&nbsp;an establishment called the Silken Knot accessed from the courtyard of the Deepking's Hold, which caters to what few wealthy travelers and refugees have arrived in Gracklstugh in recent tendays. In other words, Murghol is ill at ease with Themberchaud's reign, but does not say any more openly.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SCOUTING</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> <span class="caps">THEMBERCHAUD</span>'S <span class="caps">CAVERN</span>&nbsp;<br>
Yzak and Zap sneak on foot across the city under cover of a Pass Without Trace spell from the ranger, crossing Laduguer's Furrow into the Southfurrow District with ease. Arriving at Themberchaud's Cavern, they see the small Keepers of the Flame headquarters is sparsely peopled, but that there are a couple of new faces standing guard at the cavern's mouth: a pair of red half-dragon soldiers.</p>
<p>Pressing past these wardens, the diminutive duo hear a&nbsp;huge rumbling, and feel it in the stone at their feet. Rounding a bend in the passage, they see Themberchaud's cavern is bereft of treasure, it having been replaced with rivulets of lava and molten metal – and a huge metal man nearly the size of a stone giant steps toward a blazing rip in reality with one last armful of treasure. The dragon has moved his vast wealth onto the Elemental Plane of Fire! Gazing through the shimmering, heated air and the glare of the molten sea through the portal, Yzak is able to see a distant rocky isle dominated by a tower. Zap tries to dash toward the golem to steal some small precious handful, but is too far to make it before the construct strides to the Inner Planes. The ranger and rogue head back to rejoin their fellows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zimmerl investigates the matter of Gracklstugh's teleportation circle. Asking the pertinent people, the drow finds that it is located in a heavily-guarded courtyard of the Deepking's Hold. When none of his sources are forthcoming with the circle's particular rune sequence, he psionically tricks an old priest into believing that the city's fate rests upon his response. "By Laduguer's beard!," the priest exclaims, promptly surrendering the correct sequence.</p>
<p><span class="caps">COMPLETING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TRADE</span>&nbsp;<br>
With the party reunited, Werz Saltbaron meets them in the common room of the Gholbrorn's Lair, with a small entourage at his side. Werz proudly proclaims that, despite some unusual unrest in the halls of the lairds (no doubt caused by soulblade assassins) he has honored the heroes' request, saying that Clan Ironhead has arranged for hundreds of spears, crossbow bolts, warpicks, shields, and other armaments in exchange for the exquisite Blingdenstone salts. However, Werz wants 10% of the value of the trade as brokerage fee – roughly 1500 gp. Yzak asks to speak privately, and Werz brusquely informs Murghol that he will be using one of the inn rooms for the conference – however, Zimmerl walks in as well, Zap enters invisibly, and Jagh shifts into oscuip form (a multi-legged rodent), slinking in the shadows. Thus Werz's entourage is left in the common room with the duergar xarrorn Ular Xardelvar and the deep gnome merchant Ariana.</p>
<p>Werz is wary when the party says they will have continued dealings in the city and that he should give them a break, believing they will run away, never to be seen again. The merchant needs proof that his business partners will be steady. Yzak dramatically removes his disguise, revealing himself as the great fugitive-at-large who vows to keep returning to Gracklstugh until the tyrant wyrm Themberchaud is dead. Moved by this display of defiance, Werz agrees to drop the finder's fee, and grudgingly even agrees to make moves among the Merchant Council to find allies against Themberchaud.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LEAVING</span> A <span class="caps">TRAIL</span> OF <span class="caps">BLOOD</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having struck an accord, the heroes are ready to simply walk to their shipload of weapons at the Darklake Docks and have Zap use a Scroll of Teleport Circle to bring them and their weapons back to Blingdenstone. As they leave the inn, however, they spot a familiar face: Galax'Arix'Taklak'Hagnar'Irtos'Sniv'Kashak'Meepo, Keeper of the Flame and Yzak's great-great-grandfather. As the ancient kobold obliviously goes on his business about the city, a ruthless duergar assassin appears into the visible spectrum, psionic blade manifesting and stabbing Galax in the back as an adviser to Themberchaud.</p>
<p>As the Empty-Scabbard Killer disappears into a shadowy alley, the heroes rush to Galax's side: Zimmerl manifests a psionic revivification, bringing the old kobold back before his soul can depart for Kurtulmak's lair. Then, Zap promptly knocks Galax unconscious and kidnaps him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rumbles of unrest echo from the south as the Killers' deeds resound throughout the city. As guards run toward the trouble, the heroes decide to rob the Blade Bazaar merchants blind. Zap makes an illusion of Yzak peeing on the brazier lighting the Themberchaud shrine, and Jagh shifts into ankylosaur form, knocking the brazier over. An azer (a fire elemental dwarf-like being) attacks them for their disrespect of Law, and is promptly slain for his troubles, with Vesper's jaws piercing his copper skin, his blazing beard dissipating as he falls dead on the ground. Several duergar xarrorn fire-lancers, bodyguards to a nearby merchant, close in on the heroes as they disrupt the peace of the city. Their fiery blasts singe the heroes, but are not enough to cause any mortal wounds.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884416/Azer2.jpg?1532811083"></p>
<p>With Dino-Jagh leading the charge down the crowded street (Ariana on his back), the heroes make their way toward the Darklake Docks, with Ular Xardelvar washing his hands of the chaos and running toward his clan holdings in Laduguer's Furrow. Ariana follows the heroes. For their own part, Zap and Yzak snatch what valuables they may from trading stalls on their way out.</p>
<p>Reaching the docks and finding their boat loaded as promised, Yzak again removes his disguise, but this time in public. While some of the many slaves on the docks see a quick chance at riches &amp; freedom by capturing him, many more see the beastmaster/cavalier as a hero to follow in defying Themberchaud. Combined with the concurrent assassinations of certain authority figures, this pushes the city off the edge of civil war. With a great cry, the Father of Flame Themberchaud rouses himself from the Deepking's Hold, taking wing to personally quell the slave revolt. Each beat of his mighty wings brings the wyrm closer to the heroes on the docks. Taking no chances, Zap produces one of the Teleportation Circle scrolls and reads its incantations. In the blink of an eye, they are removed from the tumultuous City of Blades. The hardy gnome powers through the difficulty of the brief journey (due to choosing a faerzress-suffused destination), and the heroes, Ariana, the unconscious Galax, and even the cave lizard arrive on target, finding themselves in the quiet safety of Stoneheart Quarry in svirfneblin lands, having accomplished their mission to procure arms for the looming Battle of Blingdenstone.</p>

At Stoneheart Quarry, Jagh shifts into earth elemental form in order to carry the shipment of duergar weaponry meant to arm the deep gnomes of Blingdenstone against the Pudding King. The faerzress-suffused stone of the quarry empowers Jagh's connection to nature, adding to the strength of his new stony body.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PASSING</span> BY <span class="caps">PICKSHINE</span> <span class="caps">MINES</span>&nbsp;<br>
Traversing a familiar intersection in the endless maze of the Underdark, the heroes pass by the entry point to the network of mine shafts run by Clan Pickshine. Once again overseeing the loading of a wagon is Dasco Pickshine, the complex's operations manager. Dasco takes time to give mocking praise to the heroes, particularly Zap (who broke his nose with an axe handle when last they met, some 11 days prior). As the oddly aggressive gnome heckles them, there is the sound of a horn blowing in the distance – the mine has been breached. The gnomish miners hunker down in their bunkhouses as Dasco loads his crossbow and the heroes stand ready for battle.<br>

<p><span class="caps">ARROW</span>-<span class="caps">FODDER</span>&nbsp;<br>
The first wave of demons are wretched, pathetic fiends meant to whittle away at the heroes' resources, and perhaps provide tactical insight to their masters by the manner of their deaths. These include manes and dretches, as well as banelings and pustuloids (which die in a cloud of toxic spores), as well as a couple of ceaselessly hungry maw demons. All of these fiends rush the heroes, but are destroyed in short order. Several of these demons bear at least superficial relation to Juiblex, the Abyssal prince of slimes and jellies, and all of them at least have some sort of oozy sheen upon them.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884421/Tanar_ri_-_Mane__Bar-Lgura.PNG?1532812299"></p>
<p><span class="caps">INFINITE</span> <span class="caps">HORDES</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ABYSS</span><br>
The next wave is comprised of babau and bar-lguras. The babau, though proficient in spear-fighting, prefer to disrupt their foes from a range with weakening gazes directed at Jagh, or Heat Metal spells aimed at Zap's sword, preventing the rogue from sneak attacking with his favored weapon. The leaping bar-lguras, akin to hulking orangutans, bring their brawn to bear in unexpected ways; Yzak is surprised when the ape-like fiends are able to leap to Vesper's level. Jagh is likewise taken aback when his own foe goes invisible, displaying magical power that is followed up on by another casting Phantasmal Force, trying to frighten Yzak with images of a demonic dragon. Yzak resists this fear, and Earth-Jagh is able to use his elemental tremorsense to target the demon-ape.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884422/Tanar_ri_-_Dretch__Babau__Hezrou.jpg?1532812332"></p>
<p>The urgently menacing bar-lguras are quickly slain, but the irritation of the babaus remains as a third wave arrives. The heroes, meanwhile, have withdrawn to the mine complex's entrance, creating a bottleneck as Earth-Jagh fights on alone outside. The new wave consists of a rarely-seen Herald of Rot, whose disease-ridden presence is sufficient to prevent any sort of healing around it, and its escorting chasme and vrock. The vrock and herald join the assault on the mine entrance, using their area spore attacks to punish the gathered heroes. Meanwhile Yzak throws up a Silence spell to preempt the chasme's horrid droning; the chasme instead joins the effort to bring down Jagh just as a babau successfully hits the druid with his weakening gaze.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884423/Tanar_ri_-_Glabrezu___Vrock.jpg?1532812361"></p>
<p>The final wave of this war band is comprised of its leader, a glabrezu, and his hezrou bodyguard. The fearsome glabrezu casts Power Word: Stun on Yzak as the hezrou charges toward Jagh. When Yzak loses concentration on Silence in the melee, it is too late; the chasme has already been vanquished. Still, this latest arrival compels the heroes to retreat into the mine, the glabrezu dispelling Zimmerl's cloak of air so as to better rip the mystic limb from limb with his huge pincers. The hezrou's stench ability is wasted fighting an elemental.</p>
<p>As Jagh melds into the stone to move inside the mine, the heroes are able to pour their whole strength on the glabrezu in the close quarters of the mine tunnel. Zap Rowsdower, re-armed with his cooled shortsword, deals the deathblow.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AFTERMATH</span>&nbsp;<br>
With the Pickshine miners cheering their win over their demonic foes, Yzak has a look around the complex, using his trained ranger senses to search for signs of his favored enemies, the fiends. As he investigates, the kobold runs across an unsettling sight deeper in the mine – a dead svirfneblin encircled by runes painted in ooze, with more ooze leaking out of his ears. Scattered about the main circle are a dozen smaller circles, each with a drop of ooze in the center as a focus. Once informed, Zap determines this was the site of a demon-summoning ritual. Further, the arcane trickster is able to reverse-engineer the ritual to glean its full nature, allowing him to scribe a scroll of Conjure Lesser Demons.</p>

<p>In which the heroes contend with the Pudding King and his royal oozes as the coalition of svirfneblin, wererats, elementals, and ghosts clash with Juiblex's slime horde in the Battle of Blingdenstone.</p>
<p>Day 57 – Ches 15 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">RETURNING</span> TO <span class="caps">BLINGDENSTONE</span><br>
Informing Dasco Pickshine of the ritualistic murder of one of his kin (after casting Speak With Dead on the corpse and finding the killer to have been the Pudding King), the heroes set out back toward the deep gnome settlement, where Jagh (still in earth elemental form) carries the load of duergar-crafted weapons through the gate. As they approach, Yzak's great-great-grandfather Galax'Arix'Taklak'Hagnar'Irtos'Sniv'Kashak'Meepo comes to, having been knocked out by the party before teleporting from Gracklstugh. The old kobold is aghast at being brought into gnomish lands (especially as a cleric of Kurtulmak, the kobold god who was tricked by Garl Glittergold) but is told that something great awaits him within.</p>
<p>The community within acts as if under siege – the gnomes, especially on the outskirts, seem violent and suspicious. The women (svirfneblin society being extremely gender-segregated) manage dwindling stocks of fish and crustaceans in small pools within the village, tending to fungi and lichen farms and culling the last of the rothé herds as the Pudding Court lays siege to their supply routes.</p>
<p>Helping to direct these efforts is none other than Jimjar. After a friendly welcome and the heroes telling their exploits of the last tenday, the group is passing through Blingdenstone when they see Glyphic Shroomlight giving a sermon to a large crowd. The young acolyte of Segojan Earthcaller, normally nervous and halting in his speech, seems to have gained a clarity of purpose as threats descend upon the village. Glyphic says that in this sacred City of Speaking Stones, blessed by Segojan himself, the time for passive prayer is long past – the time for deeds has come. Those blessed by the Earthfriend – like the heroes – should direct their efforts against the servants of evil Underdark deities like Blipdoolpoolp, Laduguer, Diirinka, the Great Mother, Laogzed, Ilsensine, and especially Lolth.</p>
<p>As the inspired deep gnomes go forth in their efforts, the wacky weaponsmith Pingtu approaches the heroes with a weapon he has come up with called a "nooker": a flat club resembling the tail of a beaver in the Realms Above, with a short handle on the narrow end and the wide end curved over at a sharp angle. The weapon is mostly smooth, with one serrated edge. The flat edge can knock a humanoid unconscious with a carefully placed blow to the spine,&nbsp;while the serrated edge can sever the same.</p>
<p>At Diggermattock Hall, seat of the provisional government, the heroes deliver the duergar-forged arms shipment, as well as the fungal reagents from the now-torched&nbsp;Neverlight Grove. Chief Dorbo asks if they are ready to launch the offensive against the Pudding Court, but with the eventful day behind them the heroes opt to retire to Zap's estate for the evening. Dorbo declares that, in the morning, he and Chief Chipgrin of Clan Goldwhisker will lead the main force from the Steadfast Stone while the heroes deploy from the Goldwhisker Warrens to strike directly toward House Center to face the Pudding King. The earth elementals controlled by the Stoneheart Enclave will lead the attack, followed by the sturdy Goldwhisker wererats, with the deep gnomes staying back as rearguard and ranged support. The ghost of Burrow Warden Jadger will lead the svirfneblin spirits in a supporting role.</p>
<p>Back at Plowfuddle, Galax is delighted to find Har'lothchath. The red wyrmling is put forth by Yzak as a potential replacement for Themberchaud as Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh. Galax is at first astounded by this preposterous proposition, but his outrage turns to homage as Yzak speaks of the dragon's tyranny, and how things might be better if young Har'lothchath were to receive proper tutelage. Galax thus becomes the wyrmling's first acolyte and kobold servant.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, Jagh scries upon the Pudding King, finding him seeking entry into the royal sphere of House Center, only about 800 feet away (as the xorn tunnels, anyway). The heroes then finally take a well-deserved rest, enjoying the appointments made by Jimjar in their absence, ending the most active single day of their adventuring careers thus far.</p>
<p>Day 58 – Ches 16<br>
<span class="caps">INVADING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PUDDING</span> <span class="caps">COURT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Leaving Prince Derendil in command to valiantly hold Plowfuddle against all foes (and not ruin the stealth of their approach with any impetuous charges or vainglorious oaths), the heroes and a squad of svirfneblin crossbowmen head to their appointed task. The first chamber they come to is a refuse pile, where the mostly-digested corpse of a svirfneblin lies among a heap of trash. After an opening skirmish with a pair of oozes – a Mage Handed ball-bearing plopping into a gelatinous cube to reveal its location, and an ochre jelly splatting down from the ceiling) – the heroes are surprised to find the sputtering form of a dust mephit crawling from the trash. Sent with several fellows by Zimmerl nineteen days prior to spy on the Pudding Court, the impish elemental had been unable to report since the heroes had left Blingdenstone soon after the assignment. In the meantime, this mephit – sole survivor of the scouting party – has seemingly lost its mind, speaking of the irresistible hunger of Juiblex and the beauty of death. Before its fearful ranting can unnerve the gnomish troops, Zimmerl destroys his wayward agent with a psychic blast.</p>
<p>Approaching House Center, the heroes see dozens of oozes writhing across the surface of the royal sphere. Held in reserve for the moment, these slimes do not surge forward to attack for the moment. One reddish-brown spot in the roiling mass does creep forward, however, revealing itself as a gibbering mouther! This abomination formed from the mass of its past victims attempts to devour the heroes, but is quickly vanquished.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884618/GibberingMouther.PNG?1532854219"></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">NEXT</span> <span class="caps">GENERATION</span>&nbsp;<br>
Inside the royal sphere, the group finds the New Burrow Wardens. The scrappy band of svirfneblin youths have found themselves in over their heads as they have gone on an unsanctioned raid behind enemy lines. Their leader, Trisk Adamantelpiece, desperately tries to stanch the wound of one of his comrades, who clings to the stump of a severed arm. After arguing for a time over the wisdom of Trisk leading this sortie before he is fully prepared, Jagh is about to finally offer healing to the wounded lad when Trisk adamantly denies such aid, saying the gods did not help the gnomes reclaim their city; he won't accept divine blessings now; he is only looking to tie a tourniquet. Zimmerl bypasses the problem by offering psionic healing instead, but the boy's arm remains maimed. Trisk and his would-be Burrow Wardens follow the senior&nbsp;heroes' guidance and sneak out of the battle.</p>
<p><span class="caps">KING</span> <span class="caps">PHARRAN</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CONQUEROR</span>&nbsp;<br>
Zap bypassing some pit traps and portcullises, the group navigates the halls of House Center to find a throne room. Several svirfneblin skeletons litter the floor, including one with a bent silver crown which serves as a footstool for the current occupant of the throne: a gaunt drow wight flanked by a pair of animated gnomish skeletons and another pair of drow zombies. The wheezing wight turns its hollow eye sockets toward the heroes, asking who they are and if they have come to pay homage to the "conqueror and rightful king" of Blingdenstone, Pharran Nicostas. Zimmerl replies to his fellow Menzoberranyr, saying that in Pharran's absence from the City of Spiders, much has changed. Zimmerl promises that his own House Oblodra (which has been destroyed) has much to offer in alliance to Pharran's liege matron of House Duskryn. Pharran decides that he has done too little to advance his kingdom, taking up his sword (cobwebs falling off the scabbard as he does so). Marching out of the nearest doorway, Pharran is immediately ambushed by a patch of green slime falling on him. Falling off the ramp down into the pool of ooze, the petty despot is swallowed up by the slime.</p>
<p>IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HALL</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PUDDING</span> <span class="caps">KING</span>&nbsp;<br>
Coming to a chamber with an old and worn gnomish statue at its center, the heroes find the elusive Pudding King, who welcomes his manxome and frumious foes on this frabjous day, telling these beamish boys to galumph along to their deaths! Callooh! Callay! The Pudding King commands "Prince Livid" (an arcane ooze) and "Princess Ebonmire" (an elder black pudding), to destroy the heroes as he retreats to the hallways beyond. Yzak flies past these royal oozes upon Vesper, intent upon regicide, but the Pudding King is saved for the moment by the gelatinous cube he is standing in! Jagh remains in the water elemental form he has assumed for the Battle of Blingdenstone, citing acid resistance. Meanwhile Zap's mysterious dagger plundered from the Oozing Temple glows red and radiates a sense of contentment as he strikes the oozes.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884428/PuddingKing.PNG?1532812935"></p>
<p>Soon after fighting begins, none other an ooze than Glabbagool turns up on the scene, fighting Juiblex's call and battling alongside the heroes rather than the Pudding King. As the ooze war intensifies, a manifestation of the will of Ghaunadaur, god of oozes, abominations, and outcasts, appears in the form of a churning deep purple mist with a golden eye at its center. Bathing the Pudding King in a fiery orange light and healing his maladies, the mist changes in color to a dark red, then black.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Pudding King gets one Disintegrate spell off at Yzak before his ooze "armor" is destroyed, and his Dominate Person spell fails to enchant the ranger before Zap arrives on the scene and casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter, breaking the insane deep gnome's fragile willpower. Zap deals a dolorous stroke with his dagger, dealing a mortal wound. The Pudding King, leaning limply against Zap's blade as life leaves him, sincerely thanks Zap for his death as his body goes to fulfill the endless hunger of Juiblex – the Pudding King screams that the Faceless Lord will consume the banquet of the Queen of Fungi as his body morphs into a disgusting goo.</p>
<p>The death-dealing dagger, drow script glowing red on its blade, speaks in Abyssal to Zap as it reveals its name, the Blade of the Lurker. Granting Zap a resistance to acid, it also bestows madness upon him as the rogue comes to believe that he is defined by what he consumes.</p>
<p>As the Pudding King perishes, his ooze horde loses its cohesion. Outside, Chief Dorbo's warhorn sounds the call to quit the field, their bloody work done. Glabagool is among the afflicted oozes, and cries disjointedly for help as it begins to lose its intellect. The golden eye of Ghaunadaur glows wickedly.</p>

<span class="caps">METAMORPHOSIS</span> OF <span class="caps">SLIME</span>&nbsp;<br>
With their gelatinous friend Glabbagool about to lose its sentience following the Pudding King's demise, the heroes appeal to That Which Lurks, Ghaunadaur, whose herald floats midair in House Center. The former member of the Dark Seldarine promises Glabbagool can retain its intellect if it will lead the remnants of the Pudding King's horde, converting them to Ghaunadaur's worship and hunting down the demon-tainted oozes of Juiblex.<br>
<br>

Returning to Inner Blingdenstone, the heroes are greeted with a celebratory concert of sorts at the Singing Stones tavern, where the minstrel Garra Songstone conducts a crystal orchestra, subtly altering the pitch of vibrations emitted by individual stones, creating an effect not unlike an assemblage of harpists. Even dwarves have difficulty perceiving the "notes", however, let alone appreciating their beauty, so all the party save Zap can only politely nod their thanks.</p>
<p>Adjourning to the Foaming Mug, the heroes join the settlement's luminaries for a victory feast. Chief Dorbo Diggermattock passes around a decanter of gogondy, a magical gnomish wine infused with ruby dust known to induce sometimes-prophetic visions. Though at first wary of some kind of treachery, the heroes drink deep of the wine, which puts them into a mystical trance wherein they commune with beings from beyond the mortal plane. Receiving information from Entemoch, the Prince of Good Earth Elementals, as well as a solar – a mighty angel in service to Garl Glittergold, the chief gnomish deity – the heroes are able to learn with great certainty about their archenemy Ilvara Mizzrym and her position, as well as the sanity and trustworthiness of the Blingdenstone leadership such as Chief Dorbo, or the Segojan priest Glyphic Shroomlight. Finally, they are told that their next destination should be the dwarfhold of Gauntlgrym, defying group expectations that impeding the impending nuptials between Zuggtmoy and Araumycos would be their next great task.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">HAIL</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">KING</span>!&nbsp;<br>
With assurances from higher powers regarding his course, Zap (over Yzak's objections) gives Senni Diggermattock the Crown of Schnicktick, retrieved from the last svirfneblin king's skeleton in House Center. Quartermaster Senni in turn gives the bent, silver circlet to Glyphic Shroomlight, priest of the city's patron deity Segojan Earthcaller, to rightfully crown whom he will as the new King of Blingdenstone. With a hearty cheer and a bit of pomp, the gathered svirfneblin and their foreign heroes graciously kneel to King Dorbo as their new sovereign. Despite Yzak's fears, Chief Chipgrin of the Goldwhiskers does not overtly complain of this regal ascension.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884433/Dorbo_Diggermattock.jpg?1532813749"></p>
<p>One of the first people whom the new monarch addresses following his coronation is Zap Rowsdower. Traditionally, svirfneblin monarchs retain seven councilors, and Dorbo wants Zap as his chief of covert security – his spymaster. Zap politely declines for the moment, but says that after the demonic incursion into the Underdark is dealt with, he may retire from his life of adventuring and bounty hunting to take up such civic duties.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ROYAL</span> <span class="caps">AUDIENCES</span><br>
The ghost of Burrow Warden Jadger, seeing that his beloved city is in good hands, is ready to pass from the Material Plane to live with his gods in the peace of the Golden Hills. As his one last request, he asks that the seasoned heroes who all but won the Battle of Blingdenstone will help to guide his protégés, the New Burrow Wardens. The party reluctantly agrees. Jadger and the rest of the svirfneblin spirits, content that their earthly business is no longer unfinished, pass beyond the mortal veil.</p>
<p>As the revelry continues, a pair of guards enters the Foaming Mug from without, saying that a telepathic gelatinous cube is requesting audience. King Dorbo grants it. Glabagool oozes in, attracting the attention of all present, and spouts the dogma of Ghaunadaur: that all creatures have their place, and all are fit to wield power. Those who hunt weed out the weak and strengthen the stock of all. Those who rebel or walk apart find new ways and try new things, and do most to advance their races. Finding nothing noxious with this credo, Dorbo tentatively welcomes this new Pudding King – the valor of which the heroes and several gnomes vouch for – and its converted slime horde as a strange and unexpected part of the community.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DIVINATORY</span> <span class="caps">TRICKERY</span>&nbsp;<br>
Returning to Plowfuddle after the feast, but before retiring for the evening, the heroes decide to use their remaining spell power to befuddle Mistress Ilvara, scrying on her and her drow as they are holed up at an adamantine tower, a Daern's Instant Fortress that Zimmerl recognizes as an Underdark landmark known as Fendlestick's Folly. After realizing they are being scried upon themselves – thanks to the gnomish crab automaton – they put on a bit of mummery, and without revealing Zap's continued survival (thanks to his svirfneblin Nondetection), the party is able to trick Ilvara into heading toward Entemoch's Boon.</p>
<p>Day 59 – Ches 17<br>
<span class="caps">BYPASSING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SILKEN</span> <span class="caps">KNOT</span>&nbsp;<br>
In the "morning", the heroes strike out for Entemoch's Boon to meet their destinies, again leaving their various companions behind. After a few hours of travel, they are hailed by Hurley Spindletoe, a clearly drunk deep gnome, who invites them to the source of his revelry – a secret den of iniquity called the Silken Knot. Though perhaps tempted, the party decides they have urgent business and carry on toward the equally hidden Entemoch's Boon.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PRE</span>-<span class="caps">BATTLE</span> <span class="caps">ENCOUNTERS</span><br>
Reaching the sacred cavern of Entemoch's Boon, Jagh utilizes the summoning circle there to conjure a gang of mephits bound to his will. These earth-adjacent creatures – a dust, magma, and mud mephit – help to secure the perimeter against the drow onslaught that the heroes know is on the way.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884431/Magma_Mephit.PNG?1532813531"></p>
<p>Next, the heroes are surprised to see Balnur Berrybrewer enter the chamber – the dwarf druid who believes himself to be the strongest, fastest, toughest, smartest, most beautiful person that he knows. Jagh's old druid circle-mate is terrified into submission when Zimmerl telepathically contacts him and deceives Balnur into thinking that he is Entemoch himself, issuing commands. "Entemoch" thus commands the druid to defend his cavern against the wicked drow elves and their depredations. The mad druid dutifully takes command of the mephit gang and stands watch, casting Barkskin and Shillelagh to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, Zimmerl's own keen, mystically-enhanced elven senses detect an invisible trio sneaking past this sentry post. Telepathically contacting one, Zimmerl quickly finds that they are duergar, and deduces that they are Empty-Scabbard Killers, hired by Ilvara in Gracklstugh to join the pursuit party. Initiating mental contact, the psion impersonates the illithid Qualux, who had taken command of that assassins' order (and subsequently was slain by the heroes in their second delve into the Whorlstone Tunnels), telling these duergar soulblades that the drow never intended to pay them, and that they were under no obligation to die in such service. Instead, "Qualux" orders these gray dwarves to turn on their treacherous employers, joining the mephits and druid in defending the tunnel from which they know Ilvara and her minions will emerge.</p>

<br>
The heroes and their allies deceived into service – the mephits of dust, mud, and magma, the mad druid Balnur Berrybrewer, and three duergar soulblades of the Empty-Scabbard Killers – stand ready to engage the pursuit party from Velkynvelve at Entemoch's Boon. The first wave of Ilvara's underlings are quaggoths and a giant spider. These minions draw the heroes out, the mephits encircling the giant spider as the party and Balnur engage the quaggoths. The next wave, common drow soldiers, fire a volley from their hand crossbows at the exposed heroes, but the insidious drow sleep poison fails to remove anyone from the fight. Meanwhile Yzak ignites Dawnbringer, the Sunblade sending away the darkness and burning the eyes of the drow.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VELKYNVELVE</span>'S <span class="caps">ELITE</span><br>
From a shadow cast by a stalagmite appears a hooded drow wielding a blade of pure darkness, dealing a vicious necrotic strike to the unexpecting Zap, and going on to cloak himself in shade. Jagh, in earth elemental form, moves up to take the brunt of this assassin's assault.</p>
<p>Asha Vandree, junior Lloth priestess to Ilvara, appears next, summoning a swarm of spiders against Vesper and the two diminutive heroes mounted upon the bat (Yzak and Zap). The conjuration spell's power interacts poorly with Yzak's shield (wrought from the shell of a flail snail), causing a huge explosion in the choked tunnel, and inflicting mortal wounds upon Balnur Berrybrewer, the mephits, and most of the common drow and quaggoths, weakened by Zimmerl's psionic blasts. All of the mephits die in a burst of elemental energy, in turn slaying their spider foe. Asha herself is hit by the blast as well, losing concentration on the Insect Swarm.</p>
<p>The three Enlarged duergar soulblades, having stayed in reserve, wade into the fray when a yochlol demon – a Handmaiden of Lolth – is summoned. by the still-hidden Ilvara. The yochlol transforms into a cloud of toxic mist, attempting to incapacitate the heroes. Meanwhile the elite warriors Shoor Vandree and Jorlan Duskryn arrive. Shoor – Asha's distant cousin, as well as Mistress Ilvara's lieutenant and lover – adopts a defensive posture of the Lloth priestess, but Jorlan – the disfigured and disfavored former favourite of Ilvara's – blocks off a side passage, claiming to cut off the heroes' retreat, but in truth doing nothing to aid his fellows.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DOWNFALL</span> OF <span class="caps">MISTRESS</span> <span class="caps">ILVARA</span><br>
Ilvara Mizzrym, commander of Velkynvelve and senior priestess of Lloth, joins the battle, Tentacle Rod in hand. Ilvara looks haggard, mad even, from her implacable quest through the deep earth to retrieve these runaway slaves at any cost and sacrifice them to her dark goddess. She casts Harm on the troublesome Zap, making the Spider Queen's disfavor physically manifest as a horrible wound.</p>
<p>Yzak, waiting for this spellcaster to arrive, uses his ranger arts to cast Silence on the two drow clerics. So handicapped, Ilvara and Asha are reduced to flailing physically in melee, Ilvara with a lance infused with death energy, and Asha with her snake-headed scourge. Both they and the males squint in the sunlight of Dawnbringer. Soon both Ilvara and her lover Shoor lie dead on the cavern floor, the mistress cut down by Zap against Yzak's suggestion. Jorlan escapes pursuit from Yzak, retreating down the side tunnel to parts unknown. The sorely-wounded Asha surrenders, cut off from spellcasting and the sole drow remaining. Zimmerl telepathically interrogates her, learning that Asha was plotting with Jorlan to act against Ilvara, and with her dead will take command of Velkynvelve. Zimmerl declines her offer to turn in his comrades and return to the outpost as her lieutenant, but in exchange for her life forces Asha to offer the heroes safe haven at the House Vandree compound should they ever visit Menzoberranzan. The Vandrees are esteemed as vicious, vindictive, and ambitious even by drow standards, and are the seventh-ranked house of the city (with their matron mother, Fiirnel'ther, sitting on the ruling council) so this is no small boon. Asha is sent on her way down the passage whence she came. Looting the corpses, Jagh takes the Tentacle Rod with which Ilvara once tormented him, and Zimmerl takes Shoor's Wand of Viscid Globs.<br>

<p><span class="caps">INTERMISSION</span> IN <span class="caps">BLINGDENSTONE</span><br>
Making the short trek back to the City of Speaking Stones, the heroes set things in order at Plowfuddle before heading toward the Realms Above, where they mean to return Derendil and Amra to their homes, and make a quicker and safer journey toward the dwarven realm of Gauntlgrym. The flumph called "Jigglycloud" by Zimmerl, knowing that his place is in the Underdark, decides to remain underground, leaving the city to wander the subterranean wilds.</p>
<p>Yzak makes a quick visit to the Hall of Miners in the Goldwhisker Warrens, where he asks Chief Chipgrin if he would have any interest in ruling Gracklstugh. The wererat boss is incredulous at the request, but Yzak insists that he has the ability to apply pressure at key points in the Deepkingdom capital's power structure, and asks the chief to at least consider the conquest. Chipgrin says that he will have the party's old companions and newly-minted Goldwhiskers Topsy and Turvy scout out the city of duergar and derro, with his decision pending their full report.</p>
<p>Before setting out, the heroes (reluctantly) appoint young Trisk Adamantelpiece and his New Burrow Wardens as keepers of Plowfuddle in their absence. The heroes get free custodians for the fortified manor, and the Wardens get a training space, but Zap swears that they had best not mess it up. Getting an old and worn map of surface routes from Queen Senni (still acting as community quartermaster), the party sets off with Jimjar, Prince Derendil, the moon elf&nbsp;Amra, Yzak's ancestor Galax, and the red wyrmling Har'lothchath in tow.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RETURN</span> TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SILKEN</span> <span class="caps">KNOT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Following Senni's map toward the surface world, the heroes soon come to the same spot where earlier that day they had seen the drunken deep gnome Hurley Spindletoe. Again he beckons them to join, and this time they agree. Hurley makes an elaborate series of knocks and taps on the stone wall behind him, which slides away, revealing a gilded 100-foot bridge over a yawning chasm. Passing through an archway at the end, the heroes see that it reads "The Silken Knot" in a dozen languages. Within, they find a decadent pleasure palace, adorned in fine silks, drapery, silver candlesticks all around, incense in the air along with the smell of slowly roasting pork, and heady wine in huge jugs. All around are dozens of scantily-dressed men and women in equally fine silks, their cheeks and chests flushed, their lips pouting, their laughter high and gay. All of the deep races of all sizes and shapes are represented, many slick with scented oils. Several side rooms serve as private bedrooms or other functional rooms of the establishment, from a sauna to a massage parlor.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884440/SilkenKnot2.PNG?1532814306"></p>
<p>The host, a muscular and unflappable drow male named Xanthil, playfully laments that now that "their little secret" is out, the heroes may as well join the fun. Meanwhile a charming, middle-aged tiefling lady named Dedication ("Deddy" for short) beautifully plays a harp, singing songs of tiefling heroes slaying angels and devils alike. The heroes are Enthralled, thinking it to be the most beautful, calming music they've ever heard. Deddy then switches to a quick, jaunty tune that compels them to dance. While their hearts tell them that they have come to a wonderful hidden oasis in the dark, the heroes' heads tell them that something is dreadfully wrong.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884441/SilkenKnot1.PNG?1532814331"></p>
<p><span class="caps">EXPLORING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PLEASURE</span>-<span class="caps">DEN</span><br>
Seeing an iron-barred door into a private lounge in the rear guarded by a well-muscled bouncer, the heroes ask the Knot's protocol for entry. Xanthil explains that the custom is to stay at least a night, tipping well and availing themselves of the Knot’s services, before requesting a place in the back room’s festivities which, he says, occur once every 6 hours.</p>
<p>The party first decides to investigate the kitchen, suspecting the smell of meat to be something other than pork. Here they find a mewling and weak dwarf making endless preparations for meals. Though he is fearful, the dwarf (Hanshock) eventually admits enough to say that not everything at the Silken Knot is pleasurable, and that the place was always so…decadent. He also lets slip that he was once a priest. Changing the subject to his cooking and refusing to say any more lest "the Master" become wrathful, Hanshock returns to his duties. The heroes, however, do see several pig carcasses draining in the rear of the kitchen, and so are satisfied that there is no cannibalism afoot. Speaking to Deddy and Xanthil along with Hanshock, they discover that no one seems to have been here longer than "a few months," though Hanshock hints that there has been a small settlement here for much longer than that. "The Master", Beauty, is said to be an aasimar male who is so perfectly pleasing to the eye that many are said to fall to the ground and weep upon first glimpsing him.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CATACOMBS</span> OF <span class="caps">BEAUTY</span><br>
The bouncer Grolthik, arms crossed, refuses to allow any of the heroes into the private lounge (where he says that Beauty is "occupied with privates in his private quarters"), so Zimmerl discreetly morphs into gaseous form, passing beneath the door. Bypassing a huge circular bed large enough to hold eight humanoids and the overstuffed lounging pillows surrounding it, the drow mystic descends into a small, cramped undercroft in which several emaciated, nearly-nude figures hang suspended from chains, their faces painted with grotesque makeup and ritual scarring. Not far beyond, Zimmerl witnesses Beauty working on one of the prisoners with a razor blade and a scalpel. When discovered, he greets Zimmerl merrily while continuing his work, then chastises him for snooping. “That’s not what good little puppets do,” he says. “Puppets are meant to dance!” he screams gleefully. Zimmerl, through the greatest exertion of his willpower, resists the enchanting words, but the grisly spectacle induces a bout of madness in him: he believes that his is the path of redemption, and anyone who says otherwise is intentionally misleading him.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FREE</span>-<span class="caps">FOR</span>-<span class="caps">ALL</span>&nbsp;<br>
The still-gaseous Zimmerl hurriedly retreats from Beauty's sanctum, hurriedly informing the others of the horror below. The bouncer Grolthik, sensing that Zimmerl has broken the house rules, unfurls his batlike wings, revealing his true form as a cambion (a half-fiend, many of which are known to be the spawn of the fecund demon lord Graz'zt).<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884443/Cambion.PNG?1532814410"></p>
<p>With the brawny Grolthik quickly subdued, Xanthil draws a rapier and joins battle as Deddy remains at her harp, weaving bardic music into her tunes to aid her allies and hinder the heroes. Meanwhile two babaus appear in the rafters, demons said to have first arisen when the blood of Graz'zt fell to the Abyssal ground after he took a wound fighting the archdevil Glasya. One remains up high, casting Fear and Heat Metal, while another leaps down to fight Yzak with his spear and weakening gaze, but the ranger's training against fiends keeps him safe. The dwarf Hanshock looks on from the kitchen, cheering with every hit the heroes score. Even after Xanthil reveals his true incubus form, the demons are unable to do much more than charm the heroes to keep them at bay and slow their assault. Zap locks her down with Tasha's Hideous Laughter as Jagh battles Xanthil.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884444/Incubus.PNG?1532814507"></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BEAUTY</span> OF <span class="caps">GRAZ</span>'ZT&nbsp;<br>
Soon all but one babau are slain, with Zimmerl using his new Wand of Viscid Globs to glue it to the ceiling. As the revelers/cultists look on, Beauty emerges from the back, bringing all but the heroes to a hushed silence with a slight raise of his hand and asking about all the commotion. Then, slathering himself in the spilled blood of Grolthik, he congratulates the party on their prowess, hinting that he’d love to see more of it. “Give in!” he urges. “Show me your bloodlust!” The revelers bathe themselves in blood, following their master's lead. Beauty applauds the heroes for their valor and prowess, but laments what a mess the Knot has become. With a flick of his wrist, he dispels the Mirage Arcane, revealing the Knot for the ruin that it is, threatening madness to everyone present. The fine trappings evaporate, revealing to the unwitting cultists that they have been bathing in filth and drinking sludge. The "pigs" in the kitchen are indeed humanoid corpses. Those cultists who remain cut their own throats, leap off the chasm bridge, or simply go mad in place.</p>
<p>Summoning a glittering silver pendant set with diamonds into his hand, Beauty proudly presents it to Zimmerl: the Amulet of Vanity. He then proceeds down the bridge, the remaining mad cultists following in tow and groveling behind him. Zimmerl calls out the name "Graz'zt!" after him, and the "aasimar" turns around. For the briefest of instants, the heroes glimpse his true form: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince of Pleasure, deepest heart of dark desire.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884448/Graz_zt.png?1532814663"><br>
<br>
Graz'zt is a tall figure clad in striking leathers and silks who strikes the perfect image of untamed lust, every plane and curve of his body, every glance of his burning eyes, promising a mixture of pleasure and pain. And yet a subtle wrongness pervades his features, from the cruel cast of his face to the six fingers on each hand. Before the heroes are drawn irretrievably into this indulgence, Beauty/Graz'zt shapechanges back to his aasimar form. The heroes briefly chat with the archfiend, having piqued his interest for the moment, and learn that he, like the other major demon princes, was wrenched from the Abyss to this material world several months ago. Unlike those unthinking brutes, he wants to determine <strong>why</strong> he is here. Zap half-jokingly offers aid, as their goals do seem to overlap in wanting Graz'zt and the others to return to the Abyss. Uninterested in cooperating with mortals, the Dark Prince leaves them in the bloody ruins.</p>
<p>Quickly interrogating the captive babau, the heroes find that Graz'zt's cult is spreading in Gracklstugh, where his succubus agent Shal has installed herself as royal consort to Deepking Horgar V; the duergar nobility have begun to see the Knot as a sort of exclusive resort.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HANSHOCK</span> OF <span class="caps">HAMMERHOME</span>&nbsp;<br>
Graz'zt's illusions gone, the Silken Knot appears in its true form: a dwarven ruin, with the "side rooms" revealed as huts surrounding a small temple. Hanshock emerges from the kitchen hut, his own true ghostly form revealed. Reverting to a stronger, prouder state without Graz'zt's influence, Hanshock is extremely grateful to the heroes, and is shocked that Beauty was actually Graz'zt himself – Hanshock had thought him to be a powerful warlock of Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception, or some balor trying to make a name for itself. The ghost sets to work cleaning the ruin of its filth and restoring it as a safe haven in the Underdark. He also points to the "stage", which is in truth an altar bearing an anvil emblazoned with the holy emblem of Moradin the Soul Forger. Hanshock begs that the heroes bear this Anvil Of The Dwarves somewhere where the Stout Folk might once again ply their trade upon its surface. He is ecstatic when they say that King Bruenor Battlehammer has reclaimed the lost city of Gauntlgrym, as he had thought he might have to gift it to the gray dwarves of Gracklstugh. Jagh reverently places the item into the Bag of Holding, and the heroes leave Hammerhome much better than they found it.</p>

<span class="caps">FUNGUS</span>-<span class="caps">FOLK</span> <span class="caps">REUNION</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having left Graz'zt and the Silken Knot far behind them, the heroes wind through the twisting tunnels of the Underdark toward the surface world. As Yzak is scouting ahead, the kobold is soaring over a phosphorescent fungal grove when he notices perhaps 15 myconids milling about, as well as several spore servants, including a grick alpha and an umber hulk. Seeing that they are not dancing, Yzak sets Vesper down among them, and is greeted by none other than Sovereign Basidia, who for 35 days has led these two circles (Hunters and Explorers) in an exodus from Zuggtmoy's infection of Neverlight Grove. As soon as Yzak lands, his former traveling companions Stool and Rumpadump shuffle up and happily greet him as Basidia spreads its rapport spores to hold palaver.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884452/Stool.PNG?1532815239"></p>
<p>After telling the fugitive myconids (bound for Sporedome, far to the east) of the fiery fate of Neverlight Grove, Yzak hears Basidia's own reports. The myconid sovereign says that it has communed with its deity Psilofyr, and found that Zuggtmoy's roundabout route toward the center of Araumycos is a slow procession to gather as many retainers as possible, and will take at least four to five months to complete. Meanwhile, the other heroes arrive to join the rapport, as well as Rasharoo, leader of the Circle of Explorers. Rasharoo has scouted out several routes toward the surface, and has placed caches of anti-sunlight unguent and other supplies hidden along the way. Basidia offers the Underdark-dwelling heroes the means to find these hidden supply drops, and after Stool bids them farewell the two groups go their separate ways.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SOCIETY</span> OF <span class="caps">BRILLIANCE</span><br>
Later that same day, the group is passing through a twisting tunnel when they notice the telltale glow of faerzress from a crystal node. Casually rounding the node are an illithid and an orog, or deep orc. The mind flayer is familiar to them: Grazilaxx, of the Society of Brilliance, though he is now missing most of one face tentacle. His orog colleague's name is Blurg, and suffers no nitwits.</p>
<p>Grazillax greets the party, and as the SoB members are wont to do, asks them when they are in their mutual timeline. He hears the heroes' tales since encountering them on the Darklake 55 days ago, just after Demogorgon's rampage through Sloobludop. Graz and Blurg share their own information, agreeing that faerzress seems to have thinned in the Underdark of late, and may be responsible for the current Abyssal incursion. The SoB members also mention with distaste that Yzak had slain their derro colleague Y (who got better), though they are intrigued that Y mentioned that Zap seemed interested in joining the Society. They and the heroes concur that discovering <strong>why</strong> the magical radiation has been altered will be key to reversing the situation. Before they part ways, Graz offers Zimmerl the chance to read some psionic signs in the crystal. The drow touches it, glimpsing images first of Demogorgon rising from the Darklake, then of Zuggtmoy attended by her bridesmaids…and then of six other figures of surpassing darkness. A great fear rises in him before Grazilaxx pulls the mystic away from the crystal. Building up his courage, Zimmerl presses the crystal again for another vision, trying to learn about Juiblex the Faceless Lord through sheer willpower. His forcefulness successful, the drow is rewarded with a vision from the past, seeing the gnome who would become the Pudding King, outcast from svirfneblin society and sensing kindred spirits in the oozes which shared his boundless hunger. Before heading on, Zimmerl drops a psionic sensor at this location to spy on the Society's doings in the last hour, finding that Blurg and Graz had teleported in with a third SoB member, a troglodyte who had explored on his own in another direction.</p>
<p>Day 61 – Ches 19<br>
<span class="caps">EMERGING</span> TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">REALMS</span> <span class="caps">ABOVE</span><br>
A day and a half later, the heroes sense they are nearly out of the Underdark when the air itself stirs – something that surface dwellers would call a "breeze." As they emerge out of the earth, into a thickly-forested area with plants towering taller than the greatest zurkhwood mushrooms, Prince Derendil complains that the sun is much brighter than he remembered it, squinting his eyes against the glare. But his surface-dwelling friends look up, seeing the myriad points of light that are stars in the night sky, and a moon little more than half full.</p>
<p>The cautious heroes, moving stealthily through the trees, soon hear raucous revelry not so far from their position, noting festive music and elvish song on the favorable winds. The quaggoth Derendil, as a sun elven prince, offers to make contact with this woodland tribe. The moon elf slave Amra agrees to accompany him, hoping she has found her way home to Silverymoon. Jagh, now a wood elf himself, completes the trio, albeit in wolf form. Approaching a band of elvish revelers circled around a bonfire, Derendil declares that he is a polymorphed elf prince, a claim that is received with drunken incredulity by the perimeter guards. A (more) sober elf joins the sentries, a druidess by the name of Morgwais Nightmeadow. Jagh, recognizing her from his druidic circle meetings, shifts into elf form. Explaining that he used to be a half-orc and was acquainted with her, Jagh learns that they are in the High Forest, a kingdom-sized swath of untamed green in the heart of The North. The nomadic elves of the forest (mostly wood, with a sprinkling of moon) have gathered to celebrate the vernal equinox. Worshipers of the wood elf god Rillifane Rallathil observe the Budding with a ritual hunt to break their long fast, followed by a dance in a remote oak grove such as this one.</p>
<p>The other heroes and their companions approach as they judge these elves not to be a threat, the elves' own guard lowered by the peaceful palaver between Morgwais and Jagh. They try to immediately impress upon her the deadly demonic danger dwelling in the Realms Below, but the she-elf insists upon enjoying the evening, leaving tomorrow as a time for troubles. The heroes, having escaped the perilous Underdark, are glad to avail themselves of elvish hospitality.</p>
<p>As Yzak hangs back from the main gathering, he and Vesper perched in a tree, a wood elf beastmaster and his giant owl approach them. The elf, Thiakit Thistledown, says that today was the first of The Hunt, an annual gathering of all rangers of the High Forest. A four-day event hosting rangers regardless of race or affiliation (50% elves, with gnolls, orcs, and<br>
centaurs in equal measure, a few humans, and even a couple of halflings), The Hunt features marksmanship practice, the sharing of fletching tips, showing off hunting trophies, and&nbsp;<br>
relating stories, some of which go back generations. The main event is at dawn of the third day, when the rangers gather at the main camp to take part in an obstacle course featuring running, climbing, jumping, swimming, archery, and navigating a treacherous bog. Thiakit invites Yzak to join in the friendly competition, saying that the winner of this highly-anticipated event gains the title Leader of the Hunt, and is expected to defend their title the following year.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GIANT</span> <span class="caps">ATTACK</span>!&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Just as the heroes have settled comfortably into this sylvan gathering, thundering footsteps rattle them out of their complacency. Yzak, mounting Vesper, spies a daunting sight headed their way, in the form of a huge giant barreling through the trees. A (slightly) shorter one, a stone giant, stands just below the treeline, but the ranger's keen eyes spy him all the same. Engaging these dangers at a distance, the heroes are met with thrown rocks. The stone giant, of a strangely calm demeanor, attempts to touch and petrify Vesper, and everyone nearby him has to fight not to be charmed by his very reality-warping presence. The larger specimen, a frost giant ranging unexpectedly south, flies into a barbaric rage as the party attacks, but is unable to close effectively to melee with his devastating greataxe when he is magically paralyzed. Zimmerl psionically charms the stone giant into delivering a coup de grace, spraying brain all over the grove with an irresistible swing of the stalagmite he wields as a greatclub. The stone giant dreamwalker is then compelled to lie prostrate on the ground and bludgeon himself in the face as the heroes add their own efforts.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884454/Stone_Giant_Dreamwalker.PNG?1532815449"></p>
<p>When both giants are dead, the investigative heroes find that the frost giant bears a symbol, both carved into his leather cuirass and branded onto his upper arm: a skull with a dagger punched through its top. Some of the heroes recognize this as the profane symbol of the demon lord Kostschie, the Prince of Wrath. The rage of demons seems to have touched the surface world as well.</p>

<p>Day 62 – Ches 20&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">SHEDDING</span> <span class="caps">SOME</span> <span class="caps">LIGHT</span>&nbsp;<br>
The morning after the giant attack on the elves' equinoctial entertainment, Jagh has come out of his nightly trance alongside Morgwais Nightmeadow, as well as another druid by the name of Vaeros Fireshield, the only sun elf present in the grove (not counting Derendil). Vaeros carefully tends to the embers of the dying bonfire, heedless of the heat. Meanwhile Jagh's (newly) elven heart soars to be within this Great Wood, its moss-covered oaks and sunny glades calling to his adopted sylvan heritage. Against this idyllic backdrop, Morgwais concernedly listens to Jagh's woeful tale of demonic danger in the deep earth. The union of Zuggtmoy and Araumycos especially worries the druid, who says that all the lush beauty and bounty of this forest will die, or worse yet be fiendishly corrupted, should this "wedding" take place. Morgwais says that she will can best aid the cause by continuing her agenda of uniting the elven tribes of the forest (mostly wood elves, with a sprinkling of moon), seeking to resurrect the great elf realm of Eaerlann, the bones of which are tangled in the roots of this mighty wood. By presenting a united front, the forests' goodly denizens might help defend themselves.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HUNT</span> <span class="caps">BUILDS</span> UP&nbsp;<br>
Later, as the non-elves awaken from slumber, the sun begins to penetrate the forest canopy. Prince Derendil, who had already complained of the brightness of a half moon, hides in the deepest shade he can find as the moon elf Amra stitches him together a billowy cloak with broad leaves, with a hood to shade his eyes. Meanwhile Jimjar wants to bet on what everyone is thinking about – whether his ancestral realm of Nelrindenvane truly exists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Yzak speaks to Thiakit Thistledown, the wood elf ranger who had invited him to compete, who informs Yzak of the other favored contestants in tomorrow's obstacle course: a a standoffish female centaur arcane archer named Lulran Dweomermane and the gnoll Thrrae, the defending Leader of The Hunt. As soon as Thiakit mentions the prospect of wagering on the outcome, Yzak and Jimjar set out to drum up interest in placing bets on the unknown kobold challenger. Yzak first engages Thiakit in a footrace/archery contest, followed up by an aerial obstacle course between the bat and owl riders, winning handily both times.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884456/Scout.PNG?1532816048"></p>
<p>Onlookers now begin to gather around this exhibition. An orc, Gromzal of the Tanglethorn tribe, still thinks that last year's champion Thrrae has what it takes to best Yzak. He bets 500 gold that Thrrae will take a higher place in the next day's main event than Yzak, showing a sack of plundered elven coin from the lost city of Lothen of the Silver Spires, now an orc-infested ruin right here in the High Forest. Ignoring this obvious insult, Jagh focuses on Gromzal's shamanic totems, noting that they seem fraudulent if he is claiming a druidic tradition. Jagh, using the common Druidcraft orison to build a small campfire (which Vaeros Fireshield keeps an eye on) challenges Gromzal to do the same. The orc, feigning insult, instead shapechanges into a boar form, running about and tearing at roots and bushes with his tusks to show his strength. Jagh, unimpressed, notes that Gromzal did not do what he was asked to, and that his transformation seemed more primal and primitive than a druid's wild shape, with bones audibly snapping into place. Gromzal stalks back to the Tanglethorn camp in a huff, leaving Zap and Jagh with suspicions that he is in fact a wereboar.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884458/Wereboar.PNG?1532816295"></p>
<p>At this point Zap joins in the wagering, offering to hide in the woods, testing his own stealth against Thrrae's tracking ability. Jimjar has the good sense to add a time limit of one hour to the wager. The arcane trickster uses his head start well, taking up a skillfully-selected hiding spot and casting Invisibility to boot. Thrrae, with her hyena companion, thoroughly rummage through the undergrowth, with a few of her gnoll hunters thrusting spears into bushes and swinging axes at branches in growing frustration as time runs out. Yzak, "counting coup" on the gnoll, places a note in her belt that reads "Yzak was here" without her noticing. When the hour has elapsed, Thrrae drives her pack before her with blows and beratement, blaming her hunters for failing to find their quarry. Still, she pays the heroes her losing sum.<br>
<br>

<p><span class="caps">SHADOWTOP</span> <span class="caps">CATHEDRAL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Late that afternoon, Jagh joins his fellow-druid Vaeros Fireshield on a short pilgrimage to Shadowtop Cathedral, a high-vaulted grove of shadowtop trees that lets only a hint of sunlight down to the forest floor. Jagh takes on quetzlcoatlus form, as Vaeros shifts into a humble hawk. During the flight over, they see the nearby Lost Peaks, as well as the towering Star Mounts to the south, a mountain range contained entirely within the High Forest, snow-capped and cloaked in clouds. Deeper in, they can see the blood-red snow resultant of "wizard weather". Jagh asks Vaeros what magical artifacts he might add to his arsenal, or abilities he might gain to help defeat the Abyssal threats he faces. Vaeros responds that it is not power that the heroes require, but wisdom and courage.</p>
<p>Landing in the "cathedral", an important meeting spot of the Emerald Enclave, Vaeros changes back into elf form and throws back his cloak, revealing the order's sigil on his tunic. Several shrubs and trees move to one side as he does this, revealing a previously unexposed path. After a short stroll, the two druids come upon a third: a moon elf kneels before a huge oak, muttering supplication. As she rises, the tree itself twists and turns in Jagh's direction, opening great eyes: this is Turlang the Thoughtful, a mighty treant druid who watches over the northern borders of the High Forest ("Turlang's Wood" to the nearby townsfolk of Everlund). As the moon elf goes about her business, Jagh tells Turlang of the demonic incursion, casting Scry in a nearby pool to illustrate Zuggtmoy herself. Turlang is shaken, but worries that the great surface realms are too caught up in resolving some kind of nascent crisis involving elemental cults&nbsp;to throw their support behind an expedition to the Underdark. The treant then says "Gildenfire, perhaps it is time to reveal your true form." With that, Vaeros shifts into not a simple beast of nature, but into a magnificent gold wyrm. <img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884462/Gildenfire.jpg?1532816935"><br>
<br>
<br>
Aerosclughpalar, or "Gildenfire," the Druid Dragon, wants Jagh to know that the High Forest will not be unprotected while the heroes delve once more into the Realms Below. Having spread word of their quest to the Emerald Enclave, the party's druidic member takes wing back to The Hunt's main camp. He says that he will only reveal "Vaeros's" true identity to his companions if he feels it necessary.</p>
<p>Day 63 – Ches 21&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MAIN</span> <span class="caps">EVENT</span><br>
At dawn, the rangers gather at the main camp to prepare for the main event of the four-day affair of The Hunt. Contestants line up as spectators look on, with Zap hawking some of his salty svirfneblin fish-beer, hooking only a fat halfling too out of shape to compete.</p>
<p>Yzak starts out masterfully navigating the hidden ruts and pits pockmarking the open field in which the rangers start, leading the pack along with Thrrae. The first major obstacle is a tree to climb, which slows Yzak up along with, understandably, the centaur Lulran. Yzak leaps into the swiftly-flowing stream beyond and swims strongly to the other side, catching up to Thrrae, where he more than makes up in points with three expertly-placed arrow than any he may have lost to the druid observers by his poor tree-climbing. Beyond the archery hill is a treacherous bog, which Yzak handily navigates. In fact, his survival skills are so strong that he is able to place a marker for a patch of perilous quicksand, perhaps saving the life of Thiakit, who come in just behind him. Reaching the other side of the mire, Yzak finds only himself and Thrrae staring at the finish line. The gnoll, with no other rangers around, viciously throws a handaxe, hamstringing Yzak. The kobold counterattacks with his hand crossbow, shooting Thrrae with a poisoned dart. Handicapped, both contestants struggle toward the finish line, Thrrae crossing first. Taunting Yzak, Thrrae goads him toward the forest's edge, where she indicates she means to finish their business.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SHOWDOWN</span> AT <span class="caps">NOANAR</span>'S <span class="caps">HOLD</span>&nbsp;<br>
Trudging after Thrrae, trusting in his custom "sunglasses" for protection in the daylight as he leaves the forest, Yzak follows the gnoll to a nearby hamlet of stone cottages clustered by the road toward Silverymoon. There are several stables and an inn, all overlooked from a bluff by a small keep – a fortified hunting lodge. By its appearance and location, Yzak judges this small village to be Noanar's Hold, a popular resort among the Sword Coast nobles and wealthy merchants until dark rumors spread of the hold's Hunt Lords holding wanton slaughters to amuse their guests, or even allowing their guests to hunt each other.</p>
<p>The villagers retreat into their cottages as the rangers approach, shutting their windows and barring their doors. Just as Yzak and Thrrae are about to duel, the contest becomes a truel: an obese&nbsp;man throws open the door of the White Hart Inn, proudly bearing the unholy symbol of Orcus, Prince of the Undead. He denounces Thrrae as a Yeenoghu-worshiper (a demon lord with whom Orcus has rivalry, thanks to Yeenoghu's subjugation of Orcus's rightful vassal Doresain, King of the Ghouls), and declares also that Yzak shall die for intervening.</p>
<p>For most of the skirmish, Yzak focuses his attacks on the&nbsp;warlock of Orcus, Thrrae taking advantage of his distraction and laying into the kobold. Meanwhile the fat warlock blasts both with fiendish magic, first belching forth a Stinking Cloud and then calling down a Flame Strike upon both his foes, relying upon his Mage Armor for protection. Thrrae furiously swings her battleaxe at Yzak without much result. Yzak focuses Dawnbringer entirely upon the warlock, quickly bringing him down with the radiant blade. Thrrae turns tail and flees back toward the forest, albeit west of where the The Hunt is taking place. Yzak takes note of her course, deciding not to pursue her…for now.</p>
<p>Returning to The Hunt, Yzak is greeted by his party members, Morgwais Nightmeadow, and the assemblage of rangers. Morgwais declares that, since Thrrae was directly witnessed attacking another ranger, and given Yzak's superior archery skill, that Yzak shall be declared Leader of the Hunt. Furthermore, the demon-worshiping gnolls are no longer under The Hunt's hospitality, and if they do not vacate the camp within the hour will be considered enemies. By tradition, Yzak is expected to defend his title the following year, but for now he takes the chance to appeal to the gathered hunters, calling for any brave enough to join him in three months' time at Guantlgrym, for this year their prey shall be the demons invading the Underdark!</p>
<p><span class="caps">MEANWHILE</span>, <span class="caps">AFTER</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RACE</span>…<br>
Zimmerl, as the crowd is melting away following Yzak's victory speech, notices a fellow drow among the throng! Approaching him, Zimmerl finds that his name is Istorvir Jaelre, and he is one of the dozens of rangers competing in The Hunt. Istorvir quickly asks Zimmerl if he is a "spider-kisser"; Zimmerl replies that no, he is not a worshiper of Lolth. Istorvir approves, saying that he and his band follow the ways of Vhaeraun the Masked Lord of Shadow, the son and rival of the Spider Queen, who promulgates the radical notion that drow males are the equals of females, and is thus the Dark Seldarine deity of males, thievery, arrogance, and rebellion. Istorvir invites Zimmerl to join his band of rebel drow males who dwell in the dark heart of the High Forest – the mystic politely declines, but acknowledges the power of Vhaeraun.</p>
<p>Zap, meanwhile, is off drunkenly wandering the woods when he trips over a damnable root. As he stands, the deep gnome is suddenly face-to-face with with Blurg and Skriss, the orog and troglodyte of the Society of Brilliance. Blurg seems immediately skeptical of the rogue, asking why Grazillax wants Zap in the Society. Blurg gives Zap a quick quiz on mathematics, history, and philosophy to ascertain the svirfneblin's intellect, which he passes without issue. Zap, having established his credentials, is given by Skriss a series of tasks he must undertake to become a full member of the Society:&nbsp;<br>
-The gnome must bequeath a magic item to the Society. Power or value is not what they seek, but uniqueness and curiosity.<br>
-Visit the library of Gravenhollow, west of the Wormwrithings and north of Gauntlgrym. That is all they will say on this topic.<br>
-Investigate the asylum of Zellix the mind flayer, somewhere between the Wormwrithings and Menzoberranzan.</p>
<p>The arcane trickster immediately fulfills the first requirement, gifting to the genius humanoids the animate figurines of the hag Maven Delve that the party plundered 52 days prior in the Darklake. As Zap bows his thanks, he stands to find the two monstrous humanoids gone from his sight.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ASTRAL</span> <span class="caps">INVADER</span><br>
Packing up soon after the main event, the heroes and their followers make their way toward the edge of the forest. Before they make it that far, a silvery-grey tear in reality opens before them, revealing a sallow-skinned armored warrior mounted atop a resplendent red dragon. This githyanki knight, who chivalrously introduces himself as Farram as the astral conduit closes, declares that the lich-queen&nbsp;Vlaakith <span class="caps">CLVII</span> of Tu'narath in the Astral Plane has dispatched him to retrieve the red wyrmling Har'lothchath, claiming that the Gray Ghosts had a deal to give the dragon to the githyanki, or else promise them its service.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884464/Githyanki_Dragon_Knight.jpg?1532817346"></p>
<p>Zimmerl refuses to give in to the githyanki demands, instead telepathically commanding the knight to give up his silver greatsword, and furthermore to use his psionic powers to telekinetically grapple Farram's mount while the other heroes attack. Yzak's ancestor Galax casts Bless, calling upon the kobold god Kurtulmak to fairly judge this contest of mortals, and dashing for cover before the dragon employs its fiery breath. The dragon is quickly slain, but the githyanki knight&nbsp;is able to Plane Shift back to Tu'narath before the party is able to do more than wound him. He promises that he will be back, and next time he will be ready. His silver greatsword lies in the dirt at Zimmerl's feet, where he was mentally compelled to toss it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DECEIVING</span> <span class="caps">DERENDIL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Seeing that the heroes mean to exit the High Forest, Prince Derendil declares that he means to find his ancestral lands of Nelrindenvane with or without them, setting off in the opposite direction. With great effort, Yzak is able to convince him that his love Amra will be better off with his protection headed toward Silverymoon, and that Derendil will be better able to find his lost kingdom from that enchanted city.</p>
<p>Day 66 – Ches 24&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">SPENDING</span> <span class="caps">SPRING</span> IN <span class="caps">SILVERYMOON</span>&nbsp;<br>
After three days of flying (Zimmerl riding Har'lothchath, Yzak and Zap upon Vesper, and Jagh in quetzlcoatlus form with all the remaining companions upon him), the party arrives in Silverymoon, the Gem of the North. This beautiful place of ancient trees and soaring spires is a city largely of humans and moon elves, containing many fascinating shops brim full of maps, books, magic items, and beautiful things. Thanks to Zap and Yzak's connections to the Harpers, who hold great influence here, the city's hospitality extends to the strange and monstrous heroes and their companions. Having adventured together for two months, often fighting from the back of the same bat steed, the two finally learn that they are both Harpers!</p>
<p>Silverymoon&nbsp;is a great bastion of learning, and boasts a conservatory of music, a school of thaumaturgy, a great library, parks, the castles of many noble folk, and temples to a variety of good deities. It is a happy and welcoming place, totally opposite of the Underdark, and the magocratic republic seems the perfect place to wait out the spring until the peak summer trade season, after the winter snows have finally melted across the Savage Frontier. Amra (who it turns out is an herbalist's apprentice) is safely returned to her home. Zap and Yzak stay at a Harper safehouse, who have a strong presence in the enlightened city, while Jagh spends most evenings encamped with the Emerald Enclave in the Silverwood. Zimmerl, who has ascended beyond physical needs, simply wanders the streets at night. While so quartered, the heroes mean to craft and to buy magic items to prepare for the coming fight against the demon lords.</p>

Day 153 – Kythorn 20&nbsp;<br>
A <span class="caps">ROYAL</span> <span class="caps">SUMMONS</span>&nbsp;<br>
After three months of spring quarters, on the summer solstice, the heroes receive word from Gauntlgrym, the place they have been divinely instructed to visit next. Zap and Yzak, secure in Harper hospitality, receive official letters, their waxen seals stamped with the sigil of Clan Battlehammer. Jagh, out in nature among the Emerald Enclave, receives a sparrow Animal Messenger. And Zimmerl, wandering listlessly without need for food, sleep, or drink, receives a Sending spell. All four heroes' message is the same: "Come at once to Gauntlgrym for an audience with King Bruenor Battlehammer, to discuss matters of grave import concerning your experiences in the Underdark."</p>
<p>With this missive, the heroes know that this peaceful interlude is over, and a new campaign season has begun.</p>
</div><h2 class="adventure-log-post-title title" itemprop="name">
OOTA Session 48
</h2><div class="post-content" itemprop="text">
<p>In which the heroes accept Bruenor Battlehammer's invitation to visit grandest Gauntlgrym, recently-reclaimed pinnacle of shield dwarf civilization. There, they feel the flame of Maegera the Dawn Titan, and deal with a vampiric assassin during the legendary hero-king's welcome feast held for themselves and the various assembled faction representatives.</p>
<p>Day 153 -Kythorn 20 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">OUTFITTING</span> AN <span class="caps">EXPEDITION</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the road-weary adventurer who brought them their missive from King Bruenor Battlehammer goes off to join in the summer solstice festivities, Zap and Yzak rendezvous with Zimmerl and Jagh at the Bright Blade Brandished tavern. This alehouse is favored by adventurers, since it is luxuriously furnished and caters to everyone, no matter how uncouth, unwashed, strange, dangerous-looking, or badly wounded they are. Here, Yzak makes a speech to the assembled freebooters, outcasts, gloryhounds, and daredevils, calling on anyone brave enough to join the quest for the lost elvish realm of Nelrindenvane. His performance is sufficient to recruit one peasant boy in town for the festival, as well as an old rheumatic ranger whose hands can no longer nock an arrow, hungry for one last great adventure.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884466/Tavern.jpg?1532817965"></p>
<p>Seeing Yzak's success, Zap and Zimmerl give things another shot, recruiting a fully-equipped party of neophyte adventurers: a human paladin of Torm, a half-drow favored soul sorceress of Eilistraee, a wood elf hunter from the High Forest, a tiefling&nbsp;fiend warlock, and a dwarven battlerager&nbsp;barbarian from Citadel Felbarr. The heroes finance these novices, purchasing them potions and scrolls, and a harness of plate for the paladin, before Yzak gathers them all together with Derendil for his promised glory. Prince Derendil is ecstatic that he finally has a force to march on his occupied realm, his excitement at seeing Amra returned safe and happy to her home having faded weeks ago to bitter disappointment at "his knights'" lack of initiative. For the first tenday or so in the city, the increasingly agitated Derendil had roamed the streets asking passersby where he could find Nelrindenvane, but even in the cosmopolitan Gem of the North, common folk fear a quaggoth.</p>
<p>After getting the quaggoth/elf to describe his ancestral realm (cut into the sides of the Star Mounts within the High Forest by the dwarves of lost Ammarindar, the prince says, with stables for griffons, hippogriffs, giant eagles and owls, and even a pegasus for the king). Using his newly-crafted Helm of Teleportation, Yzak transports himself and the entire group of eight others to a place near the eastern foothills of the Star Mounts. Derendil proclaims they are "too near to see it", and must progress down the Unicorn Run for two days under the new moon, harming neither tree nor beast along their way. As a slug has fallen upon Yzak's shoulder, Derendil takes great care telling the ranger not to harm it, or any other creature along the Unicorn Run, lest it should be a deity in animal guise! Derendil is crestfallen that Yzak and the other heroes will not be joining in his liberation of Nelrindenvane, but promises that they will be justly rewarded for seeing him safely out of the Underdark.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ORDER</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GAUNTLET</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">HILVIUS</span> <span class="caps">HAEVER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Teleporting back to Silverymoon, Yzak appears in the caravanserai in the new section of the city on the southern banks of the Rauvin,where the city's teleportation circle is located. There, he notices a human knight with a touch of gray in his beard, his teenage female squire handing up his helm as he sits ahorse. Five human veterans strap on their armor and check their personal belongings as the group prepares to set out. All seven, and the horses of the knight and squire, bear the device of the Order of the Gauntlet. Yzak and the knight (who introduces himself as Sir Lanniver Strayl) bear one another good wishes on their travels.</p>
<p>Yzak returns to the Bright Blade Brandished. As the heroes sit assembled, they are approached by a freckled and sunburned human, who sits with them and is delighted when Yzak slides him a tankard in the spirit of the solstice. He introduces himself as one Hilvius Haever, a wandering seeker of fortune. Hilvius is curious why this successful adventuring band has recruited a group of novices and sent them off on a quest for gold and glory without joining their expedition, and wants to join them wherever they may be bound. The heroes question Haever about his background and intentions; he says that he is simply a drifter from Triboar taking an opportunity to join an openhanded and competent adventuring company. He tells of how two years ago he was drafted into the War of the Silver Marches, fighting under such heroes as Bruenor Battlehammer – the heroes further believe his statement that he has never killed a human.</p>
<p>Hilvius says that he is expert in the arts of concealment, and demonstrates his dexterity via coin tricks and stabbing his dagger rapidly between his fingers – he even demonstrates steady nerves when Zimmerl telepathically shouts at him during the latter, more dangerous stage of these tests. After this, and his excitement that they are next bound for Gauntlgrym, the heroes decide to take him on. Hilvius, Zap, and Yzak then go out among the festival, making a personal contest of placing ball bearings in peoples' belt pouches. In this, Zap performs an epic feat of legerdemain, but the others acquit themselves honorably as well. Everyone returns to their lodgings by their own idiom, each enjoying the summer solstice as it suits them.<br>

<p>Chapter Eight: Audience in Gauntlgrym&nbsp;<br>
Day 154 – Kythorn 21&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">ENTERING</span> <span class="caps">GAUNTLGRYM</span>&nbsp;<br>
Sleeping off last night's festivities, the heroes gather along with Jimjar, Hilvius Haever, Galax, and Har'lothchath. Before setting out, Zap pens a letter to King Bruenor to declare their impending teleportation and the exotic composition of their party. Astrally hurtling it hundreds of miles west with his Helm of Teleportation, Yzak then does the same with their gathered companions. But instead of finding themselves in Bruenor's throne room, the heroes are instead in the Great Cavern before the city gates, itself large enough to contain a small town, with forests of stalagmites, sprouting fungi, and uneven floors making footing precarious. Zap's letter lies on the stone floor. A small lake, cold and still, sits at the center of the cavern, a few stalagmites breaking its tranquil surface. Around the largest pillars and along the walls are carved staircases and balconies. Before the heroes is a group of a dozen shield dwarves, pony-mounted and heavily-laden, immigrating to the newly-reclaimed heart of shield dwarf civilization. Having grown up elsewhere in the North, these dwarves have never glimpsed the the fabled city, but grew up able to describe its hallowed halls from the songs and sagas of their fathers, as together they sing the Canticle of Gauntlgrym.</p>
<p>As the dwarven party finishes their song, they are startled by the sunlight emanating from Yzak's ignited Dawnbringer. The dwarves turn about, bristling their axes and hammers and accusing the kobold of thieving the blade from some worthy hero or sacred reliquary. Yzak refutes the insults, and is backed up when squads of crossbowmen appear on the guard posts carved high onto the cavern walls, and one of the dwarves calls down that King Bruenor is expecting such a group. The tremendously heavy doors of Gauntlgrym, gird in iron and mithral, open magically before the heroes.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884468/Gauntlgrym_door.PNG?1532818123"></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">VAULT</span> OF <span class="caps">KINGS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Gauntlgrym was once the capital of the old dwarf empire of Delzoun, and is constructed on a grand scale. The gates are wide enough to allow fifty dwarves to march through them abreast. Within, the city is adorned with icons and towering statues to the dwarf heroes and gods. Some of its cavernous halls would be large enough to contain an entire surface village; legends say they are so vast that the voices of the original inhabitants still echo in remote corners. All are carved with unerring precision, their ceilings soaring scores of feet overhead. There are hundreds of levels, twisting stairs, functioning elevators, and a system of mine carts crossing through the hub of the Iron Tabernacle. It is a place of great antiquity, poised on the edge of regaining its former glory. The city, like Blingdenstone, is by no means fully occupied. Indeed, given the relatively small size of Bruenor's force, keeping track of anyone within Gauntlgrym is nearly impossible. Most inhabitants currently live and work in the Vault of Kings.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884470/Gauntlgrym2.jpg?1532818244"></p>
<p>The Vault's high-ceilinged chamber rises above a network of bridges, stone towers, and sturdy walls carved from rock and sheathed in iron and mithral. Dozens of smalller chambers lead out from the Vault, including sprawling residential areas not yet filled by the resurgent dwarves. Squads of dwarven veterans patrol and guard the Vault. It is well-lit with Driftglobes, phosphorescent fungi, braziers and troughs of burning coals. There are comfortable quarters and plenty of food and drink. The residents happily share tales of the city's reclamation, and praise Bruenor's leadership at every opportunity. Everyone works toward restoring this imperial seat, with even the youths set to clearing cobwebs or scrubbing away at the walls, leprous with mold and lichen in the unclaimed residential quarters.</p>
<p>Zap, who grew up in Mithral Hall under the rule of Bruenor's kin before Blingdenstone and Gauntlgrym were reclaimed, recognizes a few of the dwarves here who helped the king drive out the drow of House Xorlarrin. One such dwarf, Helgrim Candlewick, is carrying blacksmithing supplies back to the forge when he and Zap spot one another. Happy that one another have survived the perils of war and Underdark travel, the two share a quick reunion, with Helgrim guiding the heroes to a vacant cluster of residential chambers which have been comfortably appointed for guests. Next, Helgrim directs the heroes and their companions through a series of security checkpoints toward Gauntlgrym's throne room.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AUDIENCE</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DWARF</span>-<span class="caps">KING</span>&nbsp;<br>
Helgrim takes them to a mighty hall lined with pillars and benches, dominated by the massive stone Great Throne of Moradin, in which sits a red-haired dwarf of fierce and proud demeanor. King Bruenor is flanked by a number of guards&nbsp;and advisors of Clan Battlehammer and allied kindreds. Although a long stone table has been set to one side, laid out with refreshments, there do not appear to be any other guests. "Welcome, friends," says the king. "I've a mind to know about the rumblings and rumors about goings-on in the depths outside my city. If ye relate to me what ye know, we can talk about what ye might want to do next."<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884473/Bruenor.jpg?1532818537"></p>
<p>The heroes respond with a litany of the dangers they have glimpsed, met, or received reliable intelligence of, telling of the rise of Demogorgon in the Darklake, Zuggtmoy's impending "nuptials" with Araumycos and corrupting war with Juiblex, and Graz'zt's own decadence and scheming. Bruenor listens carefully to what the adventurers have to say, and asking some pertinent questions about the demon lords. Once the adventurers have told their tale, they ask Bruenor about the overall plan that he says that they are involved in, but he says simply that he must consider all the information presented to him and consult with advisors. Before leaving the throne room, the party presents from their Bag of Holding a series of items dear to the dwarven heart: a prayer book, the Anvil of the Dwarves liberated from ruined Hammerhome, and the warhammer and shield of Eldeth Feldrun, sacrificed to monstrous spiders by Ilvara Mizzrym while the heroes were still imprisoned at Velkynvelve. The patriarch of Clan Feldrun descends a few steps, grieved though not surprised to hear of his daughter's death. The city's high priest confirms that the anvil is indeed blessed by Moradin Dwarffather. The assembled dwarf-lords are impressed with the heroes' dedication, valor, and respect for dwarven tradition. With the audience at an end, King Bruenor tells the heroes he will consider all they have told him, and that they will speak again at a welcoming feast that night.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GREAT</span> <span class="caps">FORGE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Helgrim Candlewick, bemoaning his colleague Rollo Summergold never being around when he's needed, recruits a few other nearby dwarves and hefts the Anvil into an enchanted mine cart, rumbling along the pitted and rusted tracks laid down millennia ago. The group goes along the cart's pre-ordained path to the Iron Tabernacle, the physical and cultural heart of the city, where broken shrines and altars to the dwarven gods are being repaired by diligent priests and laborers as the shield dwarves reclaim their home. After a hasty blessing from the clerics, Helgrim and the others bring the Anvil to the Great Forge, a dimly-lit area of furnaces, smelters, and anvils. Where once hundreds of smiths raised their hammers and voices in song, only a few now ply their trade – but in time, they will do so again. Layers of stone catwalks crisscross the cavernous chamber, providing vantage points and anchors for pulleys transporting buckets of ore and water. Some areas are raised on daises of stone, others stand in shallow pits. The furnaces heated by Maegera the Dawn Titan are worked with runes allowing the stone to handle the intense energy, and melt metal almost instantly. Tools made from this slag are enchanted with a tiny portion of Maegera's primordial fire, and the greatest wonders of old were forged by great smiths on adamantine anvils blessed by priests of Moradin.</p>
<p>Zimmerl asks about Maegera, having heard of the fire primordial sealed beneath Gauntlgrym's deepest levels. As the group goes to have a look at this living holocaust, Zap notices a series of copper wiring throughout the chamber. Yzak is the first to grab hold of this wiring, which courses pure elemental flame throughout his body. Besides the searing pain, this fundamentally changes his essence, granting him resistance to fire but vulnerability to cold, a winning way with elementals but diplomatic troubles with immortal beings. Yzak holds onto the wire, his hand smoking from the heat as the nearby smiths quit their labors to stare in amazement at the kobold's pain tolerance. The other heroes soon follow suit, branding themselves with Maegera's flame.</p>
<p>Moving on, Zap sees the steam-filled chamber where the wires seem to converge, all of them snaking through the room to connect to a twenty-foot tall ziggurat of pure adamantine, its layers carved with dwarvish runes of protection. It is through this that Maegera's elemental power is channeled. Zap's training in arcana also lets him see that something peculiar – even alien – is somehow draining energy from this power junction. Despite a thorough investigation by skill and spell, none of the heroes are able to find any evidence of what might be draining this power; indeed none but Zap even perceive that it is happening.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FIERY</span> <span class="caps">PIT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Finally led by Helgrim to an observation balcony, the heroes feel a terrific heat and see a ruddy glow in the cylindrical chamber beyond. Looking over the edge, the heat is truly ferocious, with steam billowing up as water pours in constantly from sluices in the walls. Helgrim says Maegera is said to tower fifty feet of living flame, with great smoldering black pits for eyes and many tendril-like limbs, but the only sign of its presence looking down is a whirlpool of white-hot magma that looks like a great eye in the center of the lake of molten rock. Maegera slumbers fitfully, his dreams and stirrings occasionally bringing destruction. The last time Maegera woke he was put down by Bruenor, Drizzt Do'Urden, Jarlaxle Baenre, and others, and even his stirring was able to cause a volcanic eruption which devastated Neverwinter. The earth can be heard to rumble in a continuous pulse like labored breathing.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884471/Magmin.PNG?1532818394"></p>
<p>Satisfied with seeing the primordial's prison, the heroes begin to leave when a stumpy elemental spirit scampers before them – a magmin. Helgrim says to slay the mischievous creature before it can delight in setting anything alight, but Zimmerl does one better – he telepathically contacts the magma creature, convincing it that he is Maegera the Inferno, and he commands it to leap into his prison to achieve a higher existence. The creature obeys, swatting a fiery paw at Yzak on the way, leaping down into the lava, cackling all the way. When it lands far below, there is a shuddering. A fire elemental appears on a cloud of ash and cinders on the observation balcony, with two fire myrmidons appearing in the hallway behind the heroes. Jagh casts Wall of Stone, sealing off the hall as the heroes swiftly deal with the elemental, turning to water elemental form as he drops the Wall of Stone to engage the myrmidons. Zimmerl pulls a safety lever, flooding the chamber to douse the flames ignited on the heroes by the elemental as well as hinder the fire myrmidons. Wading up into melee, the heroes destroy the myrmidon minions of Maegera.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884472/Fire_Myrmadon.jpg?1532818492"></p>
<p><span class="caps">WELCOMING</span> <span class="caps">FEAST</span>&nbsp;<br>
The Vault of Kings plays host to a grand feast, where the heroes are given seats of honor at the high table along with King Bruenor. The representatives of various surface-world factions called by Bruenor are here, along with dwarves of Bruenor's court and important citizens of Gauntlgrym. After enjoying healthy portions of meat and mead, and first pick of every dish presented by the chef, the heroes begin to mingle and socialize.</p>
<p>Yzak again sees Sir Lanniver Strayl of the Order of the Gauntlet, who says that Bruenor had spoken to him highly of the kobold as the wielder of the legendary sunblade Dawnbringer, and hopes that the heroes will be able to support the Order's crusades into the Underdark against the rising tide of demons. Jagh approaches Morista Malkin, an advisor of Bruenor's who is the Emerald Enclave spokeswoman here. She says that her druids and scouts have traced corruption of deepearth flora and fauna back to Zuggtmoy and Juiblex, and is worried by the demon threat, but reserves any policy decisions for another time when minds are unclouded by ale.</p>
<p>Zap, seeing the pin of a Harper upon the breast of a human noble, approaches Lord Zelraun Roaringhorn, who has a shield guardian standing as his bodyguard. Zap asks Lord Roaringhorn if he knows anything of Gravenhollow, hoping for leads, and is intrigued when Zelraun knows that the library is said to contain all the knowledge of the Realms Below, and that it is run by stone giants. Roaringhorn's interest is likewise piqued when Zap seems to know the exact location of the legendary library. But Zap says that he never said he knew where it was, and when Zelraun doesn't exactly specify that it was also <strong>built</strong> by stone giants, and furthermore speaks of Gracklstugh's Cairngorm clan as being the notable group of the Northdark (they being not near Gravenhollow's presumed location), Zap becomes hostile with the proud Waterdhavian lord. Roaringhorn excuses himself only to have the rogue pickpocket him, stealing the control amulet for his shield guardian. When the construct fails to follow him away, Zelraun turns and asks the inquisitive gnome if he could please help find his missing amulet. Zap feigns offense at the thinly-veiled insult, and quietly puts the amulet back in the noble's belt pouch. Perplexed, Zelraun excuses himself back to his chosen quarters.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">POISONOUS</span> <span class="caps">ACCUSATION</span>&nbsp;<br>
Several attendees of the otherwise-festive gathering note the icy exchange between the two Harpers and politely ignore it, but the Zhentarim representative, Davra Jassur, approaches Zap and applauds his focused drive and ambition in finding Gravenhollow. Though she knows nothing of this lost library, Davra says her organization is privy to many secrets which could be traded for the right price. Zap asks her rank or position within the Black Network, to which she responds she is a "troubleshooter." Before any agreements can be struck, the Zhent's wine glass drops from her hand, shattering on the stone floor. Davra clutches her throat as she falls to the floor, choking for breath. Yzak, near at hand, quickly responds, neutralizing the poison with his ranger's healing power.</p>
<p>As a hubbub rises around the trio, a dwarven servant points an accusing finger at Zap, alleging that the rogue had poisoned Davra, and that Yzak was hiding the evidence! Yzak speaks against this wild claim, albeit unconvincingly, saying that the servant more likely poisoned Davra's wine himself. King Bruenor has everyone empty their pockets to reveal any emptied vials of toxin, but before incriminating himself the servant transforms into a cloud of mist. He is promptly stopped from escaping by a Tasha's Hideous Laughter spell from Zap.<br>
<br>

<p>Yzak igniting Dawnbringer severely limits the vampire's options, as the undead thing's regeneration ceases and his shapechanging abilities fail in the true sunlight that it exudes. The heroes lay into the vampire, and are joined by King Bruenor, who lays gleefully into the assassin with his flamebrand battleaxe. The warrior-king leads the heroes in battle, directing Zap at an opening so the rogue can make another devastating sneak attack. The vampire, however, manages to charm first Yzak, who grapples Zap, and then King Bruenor himself. Before Bruenor can act against the heroes, or they sour their dwarven relations by striking the king in view of his subjects, Zap is able to destroy the vampire. For good measure, Zimmerl stakes it through the heart with the skewer from the roast boar. Bruenor shakes the enchantment from his mind.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WINDING</span> <span class="caps">DOWN</span>&nbsp;<br>
Zap casts Unseen Servant, directing the spell effect to bring the dwarven vampire corpse to his guest quarters. Bruenor, glad for a chance to swing his axe again, declares everyone should celebrate this victory! After a quick Speak With Dead interrogation, the heroes learn that the dwarven vampire is an Orcus-worshiper who sought to cast doubt on the heroes, but only recently immigrated to the city, and knows nothing of any Orcus cults nearby. Eventually, the feast winding down, the king excuses himself as guests depart. Shortly thereafter, a servant collects the heroes and brings them to a private chamber where the king of Gauntlgrym awaits them. Bruenor leads the heroes on a stroll toward the Iron Tabernacle, saying that these great stone cathedrals once echoed with the hymns and prayers of a thousand voices, and they never will again if the demonic tide cannot be curbed. Luckily, the wily old fighter has a plan.</p>
<p>"I've told the allies ye met tonight what ye told me," Bruenor<br>
says. "I invited them here to learn what is happening, to<br>
share what we know, and to get their backing for what it<br>
is I propose. Ye've braved the Underdark – the greatest dungeon of all! – an' lived to tell the tale. Ye know, better than anyone, what it is we face, but we need to know more."</p>
<p>"The Zhentarim have a stake in a secret Underdark<br>
trading post called Mantol-Derith. If ye can get them on<br>
our side, they'll guide ye there, where ye can meet with<br>
one of their agents, Ghazrim DuLoc. He can provide<br>
ye with a map to Gravenhollow. It's a legendary place<br>
built by the stone giants long ago, said to contain all the<br>
knowledge of the depths. If there's answers to be found<br>
for what has happened, ye might find them there. If ye<br>
are willing to go back, that is."</p>
<p>"I don't propose to send ye into the dark unprepared,<br>
and I hope ye make an impression on those gathered<br>
here so they'll support our cause and your mission. From<br>
all I've seen and heard, there's no one better to do what<br>
needs be done."</p>
<p>"So, what say ye?"</p>
<p>The king points out that Gauntlgrym has considerable space.<br>
and he can offer them titles, property. and the products of the Great Forge as rewards should they succeed, not to mention the undying thanks of his city and all shield dwarves – indeed, all Faerûn! He bemoans that he cannot accompany them into the depths, instead remaining here to defend his people. Neither can his famous friend Drizzt Do'Urden travel with them, as the drow ranger is off on some errand to an area of the Underdark known as The Labyrinth, questing after an item he called the Maze Engine with a warlock named Lasciel. There was another adventuring party Bruenor has heard tell of, the Company of the Griffon's Nest, a group known to have dealings with dwarves, but they are not yet seasoned enough to be of use in this deadly quest. Any other heroes – Wulfgar, Cattie-brie, Regis, et cetera – are likely wrapped up in the nascent threat that giantkind has begun to pose to the surface world. No, though Bruenor will supply any aid within his power, and is hosting this conclave to direct the factions' eyes to the world beneath their feet, the ultimate heroism will lie upon these adventurers'&nbsp;own shoulders. This is their own chance to become legends.</p>

Day 155 – Kythorn 22&nbsp;<br>
Soon after waking in their separate chambers in Gauntlgrym's&nbsp;Vault of Kings, the Harper-affiliated Yzak and Zap receive invitations for the group to treat with their faction's representative, Lord Zelraun Roaringhorn, in King Bruenor's throne room. Before accepting the meeting, the group does a bit of a background check on this Waterdhavian noble, asking around among the various visitors and Gauntlgrym settlers. They find that Zelraun vigorously pursued his talents for the arcane arts, but never lost his fondness for spending his family's considerable income on the finer things in life. Winning him over will require a willingness to wine and dine him, and potentially appeal to his gambling streak. The heroes hire out a dwarven kitchen, catering a fine luncheon to appeal to Lord Roaringhorn's epicurean side. Arriving in the throne room (built as a meeting place as much as a seat of rulership, its large hall lined with pillars and benches), they find that the dwarf cooks have outdone themselves. Zelraun sits at a bench sipping one of the fine wines they've provided, his shield guardian standing vigil over his shoulder, and a chess set laid out on the table next to him. The heroes hope that Zap's fouled-up interaction with the proud and fickle lord during the previous evening's welcome feast won't put them at a disadvantage at the negotiating table.</p>
<p>After hearing of some of the heroes' exploits, Zelraun matches their account with those of the Harper scouts engaged in charting and blocking off Underdark passages to the surface world, who have brought back similarly terrifying news of the demon lords' presence. The finest mages in the Harper ranks – a strong claim indeed – are even now researching how to defeat the demon lords and their kind. Until the surface world can organize a stronger response, Zelraun is willing to consider supporting the heroes' expedition as a diversion. But first, he wishes to test their intellect: he bids one of them match wits against him in a round of chess. Zap steps up to the challenge and wins the first game, but the experienced Zelraun handily takes the next two. Still, ever the gracious winner, the spendthrift lord loans his shield guardian to the party on the provision that Zap vows to redeem himself with a rematch upon their return from the Underdark. The Harpers have sworn for long years to put an end to unbridled evil in all its form – especially evil that wields dark magic. Zelraun knows that the demon lords prey on the weak and corrupt the innocent. This is the moment the Harpers have trained for, and his conscience calls him to act – there was never much doubt that he would aid the heroes' quest.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ORDER</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GAUNTLET</span>&nbsp;<br>
While traversing the Vault of Kings back toward their chosen quarters, the heroes are met by a dwarf messenger who brings word that Sir Lanniver Strayl wishes to meet with them in the Iron Tabernacle. Again doing legwork on the faction representative, the heroes learn that Strayl is the most respected figure among the factions here, a devout follower of Tyr the Even-Handed known for his patient determination and wry wit. In order to win points with the holy-minded crusader, Yzak suggests they make a mercy mission to the local military hospital. Finding dwarves awaiting treatment for wounds sustained on patrol against local aberrations, the heroes handily heal the worst of them, with Yzak channeling Dawnbringer's healing power to restore sanity to one dwarf whose mind had been shattered by the fiendish madness spreading through the deep earth.</p>
<p>Making their way to the Tabernacle, cultural and spiritual heart of the city as well as its physical center, the heroes find Sir Lanniver as he exits the vault labeled "Slumber of Ancients" in Dethek runes along with his young female squire. With dwarf youths working at clearing cobwebs and scrubbing away at walls leprous with mold and lichen, Sir Lanniver remarks on his appreciation for the great history of this ancient place. Yzak uses the magical stone gifted to them by the Diggermattocks of Blingdenstone, conjuring an earth elemental to help with the heavy lifting of clearing caved-in passages and lifting up huge broken stone doors, impressing the knight again.</p>
<p>Zimmerl's keen ears pick up moaning coming up from the Slumber of Ancients catacombs, which Strayl shrugs off as mostly-kindly ghosts, spirits of Old Delzoun which remain quiet unless a tomb robber were to become disrespectful of the honored dead. Yzak offers to put these spirits to rest, citing previous experience in Blingdenstone, but Sir Lanniver believes that the ghosts are quite proud of Bruenor's occupying force and the resurgence of the shield dwarves, and have been thoroughly enjoying their worldly afterlife of late.</p>
<p>Though Sir Lanniver might wish the group were more strongly of good heart, he certainly recognizes that the demon lords embody exactly the kind of evil that the Order is sworn to destroy, and sees in the heroes an opportunity to deal a mighty blow to the Abyssal hordes, scouting and softening up opposition in the Underdark while gathering valuable strategic information. To prove the worth of the Order as well as the valor of its members, Strayl pledges five veterans of the Order to the quest, promising that many more paladins, monks, and clerics will be delving into the Underdark elsewhere to smite evil wherever they find it. He also gives Zap a +1 hand crossbow "liberated" from drow possession and held in trust from the Order. Sir Lanniver has an unshakable faith that things will work out – so long as those of good intent do what must be done – and knows that together their coalition will send the demon lords howling back to the pit.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> "<span class="caps">LORDS</span>' <span class="caps">ALLIANCE</span>"&nbsp;<br>
The one faction delegate whom the party did not meet at Bruenor's welcoming feast was Lord Eravien Haund of the Lords' Alliance. Quickly gathering information as the day wanes into early evening, the heroes find that like Zelraun Roaringhorn, Eravien is a noble of Waterdeep. He is known to be a charming, sly, and worldly half-elven courtier, and so Yzak suggests they prepare a spread of Underdark cuisine, showing it as a worthy part of the Realms to be saved. The heroes invite Lord Haund to dine in Yzak's chambers. The first response is a trio of human guards, who give a cursory inspection of the room before their charge's entry. Eravien arrives with another trio, this one of strongheart halfling servants. Quite impressed with the party's culinary efforts, Eravien is pleased when Yzak suggests they wait to talk business until after dinner, and tears into the repast with a hedonistic fervor after his halfling servants have tasted a few of the courses. A hint of suspicion arises when the lord asks if one dish is roast fire beetle – certainly not an entrée enjoyed by Waterdhavian nobles. Claiming to have once been kidnapped by Halaster Blackcloak and held hostage in Undermountain, Eravien says that he is familiar with such foul foods.</p>
<p>Lord Haund expresses, regretfully, that he knows little of the developing situations in the Underdark, and asks for a full telling of Bruenor's plan as they know it, as well as how the other faction envoys have responded to the news. Zimmerl and Zap show some suspicion at the noble's interest in this information, even more so when the half-elf stands to leave with only a promise to speak with the Alliance's leader (Dagult Neverember, Open Lord of Waterdeep&nbsp;as well as Lord Protector of Neverwinter) about what he has heard, offering no aid nor even committing to an answer on whether he will or will not support the expedition, only saying that the Alliance "no doubt" will send some aid to the party at their first destination in Mantol-Derith.</p>
<p>Pressed by Zimmerl to make some concession, the lord promises that the guards and servants here in the room can follow the party's cause. The halflings look at one another in horror. As Eravien rises to leave, the door bursts open. It is Hilvius Haever. The Lords' Alliance guards make no move to stop him, and indeed seem to know him. They and everyone else are horrified when Hilvius shouts out that Eravien Haund is dead in his quarters, his neck snapped clean. "Eravien Haund" rises from his chair, demanding that his guards arrest Haever. The heroes insist on at least investigating Hilvius's claims, and "Eravien" is forced to go along.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SPIES</span>!&nbsp;<br>
Traversing the many hallways of the Vault of Kings, the heroes and Hilvius Haever, plus "Eravien" and his guards and servants, finally come to the largely-abandoned residential area where the Lords' Alliance delegation has established themselves for the summit. Hilvius, his cover now blown, admits that he is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, and when he met them two days ago in Silverymoon he was infiltrating the party to take their measure before they met with Lord Haund.</p>
<p>While in these secluded halls, Yzak, a trained hunter of humanoids, senses that this "Eravien" is not one. Zimmerl mentally compels the imposter to take on his true form while stating his intentions. Against his will, "Eravien" morphs into the strange and sexless form of a doppelganger. It states that its name is Tepilmurae, and that it was initially hired by the Red Wizards of distant Thay to spy upon this conclave, but took on a more lucrative contract from the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan, who felt snubbed that they were not invited by Bruenor despite the fact that it was their magic which of old had helped secure Maegera the Inferno and make Gauntlgrym what it is today.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884595/Doppelganger.PNG?1532852043"></p>
<p>With the shapechanger's true form revealed, everyone in the hallway girds for battle. Yzak ignites Dawnbringer and threatens Tepilmurae, saying that it can either submit to their will or be delivered to the doubtless capital judgment of King Bruenor. The guards of the real Eravien Haund, incensed at the murder of their lord, attack the devious monstrosity, one of their spears making a palpable hit. Making a show of wanting to bring in the captive for "justice, not vengeance", Zimmerl manifests a telekinetic barrier around Tepilmurae as Yzak has Vesper lift the doppelganger out of the reach of the guards' poking spears. Zap has the halfling servants run off to fetch the king to sit in judgment for the crime of Lord Haund's murder, and also whomever the Alliance's next ranking member in Gauntlgrym may be. Eravien's well-paid guards are not enthused about letting their benefactor die unavenged, but when Yzak cuts off the heads of their spears with a swipe of Dawnbringer, they grudgingly follow the heroes to the throne room.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SUBVERTING</span> <span class="caps">KING</span> <span class="caps">BRUENOR</span>'S <span class="caps">JUSTICE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Bruenor Battlehammer looks down sternly from the Great Throne of Moradin, displeased at being called to dispense justice for so foul a crime. The Lords' Alliance's next senior member, a certain Farryl Kilmander, states that though he would like for the doppelganger to be tried in Waterdeep or another Alliance member city, he understands the difficulty of transporting such a uniquely dangerous prisoner over such a distance, and submits jurisdiction to King Bruenor, who snarls at the defendant to set out its case. Tepilmurae pleads for its life, claiming that it can serve a new master as readily as its current employer(s). Not trusting the desperate words of this slippery shapeshifter, and set to punish its crime in any case, Bruenor wrathfully thunders down a sentence of death for the doppelganger. His trained eye noting the hilt of Dawnbringer at Yzak's hip and expecting greatness of its wielder, the canny old fighter asks if the kobold will carry out his sentence. Though Bruenor is not his liege, Yzak vocally agrees, again igniting his sunblade.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/884596/King_Bruenor.jpg?1532852088"></p>
<p>But inwardly the kobold considers this to be a waste of a potential asset. Using Zimmerl's telepathic network for the party, Yzak contacts his friends with that idea that Tepilmurae could be forced into their service, spreading fear, suspicion and deceit as only a doppelganger can. Zap suggests that it might even be able to replace the Deepking himself. At Yzak's suggestion, Zimmerl brings Tepilmurae into the mental link, asking the doppelganger if he trusts the party. It doesn't, but Tepilmurae reads Yzak's mind with his own psionic power, and sees the truth of the ranger's offer to kill – and then revivify – the doppelganger. With no other options, it accepts the desperate deal. Yzak plunges Dawnbringer's radiant blade through Tepilmurae's back, and as the shapeshifter slumps to the stone floor there is a solemn moment of grimly satisfied silence from the assembled dwarves. Though the heroes do not offer their own Scroll of Raise Dead, at Farryl Kilmander's request, King Bruenor arranges for the late Lord Haund to be restored to life if his soul is willing.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EMERALD</span> <span class="caps">ENCLAVE</span>&nbsp;<br>
With Bruenor knowing the party's proclivity for interrogating the dead, there is little comment when Zap begins stuffing the corpse into his Bag of Holding, though no one notices when Zimmerl, "helping" the gnome, mystically restores the doppelganger to life in the process.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Morista Malkin descends from her place by the Great Throne as one of Bruenor's advisors, approaching Jagh as ambassador of the Emerald Enclave. With her approaching directly and immediately, this time there is no opportunity to prepare for negotiations, but the dwarf-maid responds favorably to Jagh saying the heroes intend to disrupt the union of Zuggtmoy and Araumycos (preventing corruption of nature), and of further involving themselves in the Deepkingdom Civil War (keeping traditional shield dwarf foes off-balance). Morista pledges a team of three dwarven scouts to help the heroes, along with giant lizard mounts for the scouts and heroes alike. She also mentions that a moon elf druid of the Enclave, one Sladis Vadir, disappeared while on a mission in the Underdark a few months ago, with his last report sent while lodged at the Foaming Mug in Blingdenstone.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RECRUITING</span> <span class="caps">TEPILMURAE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Meanwhile, Zap has found an out-of-the way chamber and removed Tepilmurae from the Bag of Holding before it runs out of air. Zap very surreptitiously ties a string around the doppelganger's ankle, which Zimmerl has manifested a psychic sensor upon. Yzak, Jagh, and Zimmerl impress upon their new intelligence asset that it owes its life to them, and that to disobey them is death. Yzak, using his new Helm of Teleportation, will insert the freelance spy into Gracklstugh, where it is to use all of its skills of espionage, assassination, and sabotage to inflict maximum chaos upon the already-turbulent City of Blades. Zap creates illusions displaying various key figures in Gracklstugh, visualizing them for the doppelganger to impersonate them to best effect. The most key part of this intelligence briefing is for Tepilmurae to seize control of the Empty-Scabbard Killers. By directing the duergar soulblade order's missions (in disguise as Eldgrim, the hardy second-in-command to the illithid Qualux, both dead the last 98 days), as well as by impersonating certain thieves of the Gray Ghosts, Tepilmurae will find itself in a very dangerous but potentially very lucrative position. Zimmerl psionically compels the shapeshifter to reveal its price – 2,000 gp combined from the wicked arcanists employing it for the mission to infiltrate the Gauntlgrym conference. The heroes decide to match this funding to incentivize their new recruit. Leaving the doppelganger to absorb this information and accept its new fate, Zap casts Arcane Lock to keep it contained in this forgotten chamber for the night.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BLACK</span> <span class="caps">NETWORK</span>&nbsp;<br>
Returning to their various quarters, the heroes each find a missive on their pillows from Davra Jassur, the Zhentarim "troubleshooter" here for the summit. Taking the Zhent up on her offer, the party quietly boards some of the enchanted mining carts rumbling around the huge city, taking a roundabout route toward clandestine midnight meeting in a secluded alcove of the Great Forge. Leaning against an adamantine anvil, graceful as a blade, is Davra.</p>
<p>Though appreciative of the heroes saving her from the vampire's poison at the previous night's welcoming feast, Davra knows that the Zhentarim hold the strongest hand of any of the assembled factions. She believes the heroes' mission should be aided to help stop the demon lords from becoming an unstoppable problem – bad for business, and an obstacle to the Zhents' own plans impose control over the North and beyond. Still, she doesn't intend to give away Zhentish aid for free. With excellent intelligence-gathering resources and access to the established Underdark outpost of Mantol-Derith, Davra demands an accounting of all information given to Bruenor and the other faction envoys, as well as a full share of treasure gained during their upcoming delve into the Underdark. This latter point is further defined by the party as specifically the journey from Gauntlgrym to Mantol-Derith, and thence to Gravenhollow, and is agreed upon in regards to coin and gems, though if any significant magic items are desired by Davra, then the heroes all quietly agree that terms may need to be re-discussed. Jassur promises eight mercenaries to join the heroes' expedition, equaling the manpower committed by the Emerald Enclave and Order of the Gauntlet in number. All eight of these thugs know the way to Mantol-Derith.</p>
<p>Davra is not all ruthless ambition, however, and takes the time to compliment the heroes on how they handled the doppelganger spy, as well as their actions in inciting the ongoing duergar civil war. Perhaps one or more of the heroes might have what it takes to become Davra's protégé in the Black Network…<br>
As the meeting draws to its conclusion, Jassur covers herself with Dust of Disappearance and begins to make an invisible getaway, but Zimmerl calls upon his drow magic, limning her in faerie fire and stealing the Zhent assassin's thunder.</p>
<p>On the way back to the Vault of Kings, Zimmerl checks in on his psychic sensor, finding that Tepilmurae is despondently sitting in the corner of his dungeon, pondering this new take on life.</p>
<p>Day 156 – Kythorn 23&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">ENSURING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ASSET</span>&nbsp;<br>
After awaking, the party heads to the forgotten chamber where Zap has imprisoned Tepilmurae. As the arcane trickster unseals the room, Jagh casts Geas on the doppelganger, compelling him to follow their orders for the next 30 days. Tepilmurae accepts the enchantment as the price of its continued existence – and after all, doesn't this new assignment play into its strengths? Perhaps this relationship with the heroes need not be such a bad one.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TRUE</span> <span class="caps">LORDS</span>' <span class="caps">ALLIANCE</span>&nbsp;<br>
the party breaks their fast with a resplendent morning meal offered by a thankful Lord Eravien Haund, raised from the dead by Gauntlgrym's high priest of Moradin. After sharing a pleasant meal with the truly appreciative half-elf noble, they get down to business. When speaking with Eravien's doppelganger replacement, Tepilmurae was unfortunately not overplaying the lord's ignorance of current events in the Underdark – Haund's fondness for socializing has distracted him from this important unfolding event. Thus, while Eravien wishes to repay the heroes for playing a part in his return to life, the true hero in that matter was Hilvius Haever, and Lord Haund must justify any commitment to the Alliance.</p>
<p>Currently, Lord Haund simply does not see the urgency, deeply doubting the quest for two main reasons. Firstly, rumors swirl that Mithral Hall is about to follow the other dwarf-holds in withdrawing from the Alliance in the wake of the War of the Silver Marches, and Eravien thinks that Bruenor is trying to make a show of shield dwarf support for the organization to gain manpower for this expedition. Secondly, Eravien suspects that this may all be a great song and dance put on by Harper busybodies who are overblowing the threat to attract aid to their cause. Even when Zap puts on an illusion of some of the terrors they have witnessed, Eravien reminds the heroes of his elven blood, and that he is not as young as he looks – he has seen illusions before, and knows they need not depict the truth.</p>
<p>Only by appealing to the inherent sense of cooperation necessary for stability, peace, and order that is inherent in the Alliance's ethos are the heroes able to convince him to provide his faction's backing, shaming him with the fact that every other faction at the summit had heeded Bruenor's call to action. The heroes secure several Lords' Alliance agents to join their expeditionary force: five dwarf guards from the mining city of Mirabar, and three human spies based in the fortified trade town of Yartar – including Hilvius Haever and Farryl Kilmander. Eravien also reveals that a deep-cover operative of the Alliance, a moon elf named Khelessa Draga, was sent to spy on the drow over a year ago. She uses magic to disguise herself, and Eravien warns the heroes not to attack any drow until they can confirm the target is not a glamered Khelessa. The Lords' Alliance lost contact with Khelessa months ago, so Eravien doesn't know where she is.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WAY</span> <span class="caps">AHEAD</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having convinced all five faction representatives that their expedition has a chance of succeeding – and surviving – the heroes are all summoned to the throne room once more by King Bruenor, who convenes a final gathering. Surrounded by his inner circle of advisors and the surface world ambassadors, the host monarch gives his thanks for the heroes' commitment to the fight against the demon lords:&nbsp;<br>
"Ye all know the dangers and threats of the world below, and have bought that knowledge with bravery and guile. Even more, in diplomacy have ye forged the first of the connections that will see the North prepared for what might come. If we survive the coming onslaught, we'll have ye to thank, and no dwarf of Gauntlgrym will soon forget it. Ye all have the courage and conviction of heroes. Aye, I'll even say ye remind me of other heroes I've known. From a previous life…"<br>

Day 156 – Kythorn 23 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
As the party sits in Yzak's chosen chambers in Gauntlgrym's Vault of Kings planning how to deploy their expeditionary force, there is a knock at the door – it is none other than Bruenor Battlehammer. The dwarf king re-iterates his jealousy at not accompanying the heroes on their travels, and tells them that any proper adventuring company needs a name. He and his are the Companions of the Hall; in line with his&nbsp;promise to grant the heroes lands and titles when their quest is done he therefore makes the four of them the founding members of a new clan of Gauntlgrym. Given that the group formed at Velkynvelve, which means "hidden blade" in the drow&nbsp;dialect, he proposes they take the name Clan Velkynvelve in defiance of their former dark elf&nbsp;slavemasters, as the heroes shall be the hidden blade wielded by the forces of good – and alternative evil, in the case of the Zhentarim -&nbsp;against the demon threat.&nbsp;</p>

Rather than set out on a long and arduous underland trek with a large band of followers toward the secret trading post at Mantol-Derith, Yzak&nbsp;elects to use his new Helm of Teleportation, making two trips that day and two the next morning&nbsp;transporting the coalition troops to Plowfuddle. They find that Trisk Adamantelpiece and his New Burrow Wardens have – thankfully – kept the estate and its strange menagerie intact over the spring. The baby hook horrors are now four and a half months old, but the&nbsp;basilisk eggs remain unhatched. The "rocktopus" squirms around the manor at will.&nbsp;<br>

Day 157 – Kythorn 24&nbsp;<br>
After a day of the heroes&nbsp;gathering forces in the deep gnome settlement, the newly-crowned King of Blingdenstone, Dorbo I Diggermattock, pays them a royal visit at Plowfuddle. Welcoming them back to the Underdark, Dorbo&nbsp;determines why they are fortifying Zap's Rockblight manor as the heroes explain they mean to go on a proactive offensive against the demon lords. Although this is counter to the unassuming and stealthy&nbsp;svirfneblin nature, Dorbo&nbsp;believes in the heroes and pledges a dozen deep gnomes to their cause.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With a quick trip across Blingdenstone, the heroes find themselves at Chipgrin's Rise in the Goldwhisker Warrens. Yzak&nbsp;keeps an eye open to see if the wererats&nbsp;have been oppressed or neglected under the nascent Diggermattock dynasty, and finds their condition has improved since allying with their non-lycanthrope kin.&nbsp;The wererat boss calls up Topsy &amp; Turvy, the twins who had traveled for a time with the heroes before joining the lycanthrope gang. The two have a full report for Yzak, who had requested the Goldwhiskers&nbsp;scout out Gracklstugh, the kobold making a bold claim that the wererats&nbsp;could soon lord over the City of Blades. Having returned a tenday ago, Topsy&nbsp;delivers the following intelligence: that after an initial rash of assassinations by the Empty-Scabbard Killers (at the heroes' behest, unknown to her), a state of civil war has erupted between the clans. Deepking Horgar immediately fled the&nbsp;city while Themberchaud was distracted by the violence. His surviving loyal lairds have gathered their armies in the outlying districts, besieging or storming the&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;of Themberchaud's lairds. They have yet to gather into a single force to avoid presenting a tempting target for the dragon's breath. And so the civil war now simmers at a stalemate, the royalist army too fearful to re-enter the dragon-held city, while Themberchaud's&nbsp;forces have plenty of food and Darklake supply routes to withstand a siege. Meanwhile the royal consort&nbsp;Shal&nbsp;(known by the heroes to be a succubus servant of Graz'zt)&nbsp;remains in the&nbsp;Deepking's hold, presumably a hostage of the dragon. At the same time, demonic madness spreads among the population, and paranoia is rampant – common duergar barricade themselves in&nbsp;their homes, and the lairds in their strongholds, meaning fielding an army is nearly impossible at any rate, though the Wyrmsmith's elemental servants seem unaffected. The derro, already being insane, are not much affected either. Those of&nbsp;Themberchaud's&nbsp;Gray Ghost thieves, the Deepking's&nbsp;darkhaft spies, and the Empty-Scabbard Killer assassins who remain sane or derro wage a shadow war.&nbsp;Rumors abound of creatures active in the Darklake, and of&nbsp;secret rituals and offerings made to the dark waters to appease them. A number of foreigners have disappeared, and incoming trade to the city has slowed as outsiders&nbsp;depart or stay away. This last fact, coupled with Themberchaud's&nbsp;greed for the city's riches and crafted goods, means that the Merchant Council has suffered more than any in Gracklstugh&nbsp;(well, besides the slaves anyway). As Topsy relates this tale, Turvy&nbsp;mostly just mutters to himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satisfied with Topsy &amp; Turvy's&nbsp;infiltration of the Deepkingdom's capital, Yzak then asks if Clan Goldwhisker&nbsp;can offer any military aid to their expedition against the demon lords, noting that if the wererats&nbsp;commit troops, they will be counted among such allies as the five great surface world factions, as well as the heroic dwarf Bruenor&nbsp;Battlehammer&nbsp;- perhaps others will note the power and generosity of this Underdark potentate. Chipgrin&nbsp;takes to the notion, and surprises the twins by promising to send them out again on the heroes' campaign. Zap lets it be known that he doesn't trust the twins;&nbsp;Yzak&nbsp;notes it in the log and accepts the offer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In a final attempt to raise a host at their backs, the party heads to the Pudding Court, asking their old friend&nbsp;Glabbagool&nbsp;to see if the "new Pudding King" will offer any oozes to join their strike team. "Glabby" is more than welcome to welcome them to its realm – having requisitioned the old rothé stockade. Though a gracious host to its old companions who showed it the ways of mortals, the telepathic gelatinous cube thought to be Chosen of Ghaunadaur&nbsp;says that it will only send its slime minions to aid the cause if the heroes present it with reliable reports of Juiblex's cults or minions in a particular location. In that case, the Pudding Court will mobilize to drown the Faceless Lord's&nbsp;followers in caustic&nbsp;slime, in the name of Ghaunadaur.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">FEY</span> <span class="caps">REVELATIONS</span><br>
Experimenting with his new magical prayer beads back at Plowfuddle, Jagh&nbsp;summons the unicorn Snapdragon, with whom he had last spoken to after clearing the Lost Tomb of Khaem, four months prior. Though Jagh had no particular agenda in conjuring this fey, in their idle talk Snapdragon reveals that he had suspected that the druid and his companions had reached the surface world, for he had glimpsed one of Jagh's&nbsp;longtime followers – Prince Derendil. Snapdragon's realm in the High Forest abuts the Unicorn Run, the stream which Derendil&nbsp;and his neophyte adventuring party are following to try and find lost Nelrindenvane. There did he see the quaggoth/elf just two days ago. The party is pleased to hear that Derendil&nbsp;has recently been spotted alive, and wonders if perhaps the quaggoth&nbsp;wasn't lying about his heritage. Jagh&nbsp;asks Snapdragon for any fey support he can provide, but the unicorn says that defending the High Forest from the usual threats has been made more difficult by&nbsp;demonic incursions erupting from the Underdark&nbsp;out of&nbsp;Hellgate Vale and the Endless Caverns of the Star Mounts – if the heroes need fey aid, they will have to provide lavish compensation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Chapter Nine: Descent Into the Depths<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">MARCHING</span> <span class="caps">ORDERS</span><br>
The heroes decide to split their forces, bringing the four of them (Jagh, Zap, Zimmerl, and Yzak) and Vesper, plus the Harper shield guardian, and the half-elf&nbsp;Zhent&nbsp;hiresword&nbsp;Aligor Moonwhisper toward Mantol-Derith.&nbsp; The feckless deep gnome gambler Jimjar is put in command of all the rest of the faction troops (three dwarven&nbsp;scouts of the Emerald Enclave, seven Zhentilar thugs, five dwarven guards and three human spies of the Lords' Alliance, and five human veterans of the Order of the Gauntlet), as well as Topsy, Turvy, Yzak's ancestor Galax, and the red wyrmling he worships Hor'lothchath. Jimjar is given orders to march toward the Wormwrithings&nbsp;to find information about a supposed "Duskbringer", sister sword to Dawnbringer, stopping to build&nbsp;fortified campsites before making camp every night. The idea is to raise&nbsp;a line of outposts from Blingdenstone to the Wormwrithings, leaving&nbsp;the expedition to always have somewhere to retreat to in the face of a greater threat. The heroes also give detailed instructions to write down any relevant or urgent information while making camp, as the heroes will be scrying&nbsp;on Jimjar's force at appointed times. With Zap telling Galax&nbsp;not to turn Plowfuddle&nbsp;into a dragon's lair, Galax&nbsp;wants to tag along with the expedition so that if they ever draw near the Darklake&nbsp;beholder's lair, they can strike off on their own to claim it for the wyrmling. For ease of scrying, Jagh takes a small blood sample from each of the expedition members.<br>
<br>
The party sets&nbsp;out from Blingdenstone in their own particular idioms – Yzak and Zap riding Vesper, Zimmerl flying upon a magic broom, Jagh&nbsp;and the half-elven&nbsp;Zhent&nbsp;mercenary&nbsp;Aligor&nbsp;Moonwhisper mounted upon giant lizards, and Lord Zelraun Roaringhorn's shield guardian (keyed to Jagh)&nbsp;keeping pace. All this is in&nbsp;lieu of reliable teleportation options to Mantol-Derith.&nbsp;Yzak&nbsp;scouts ahead as usual, with Zimmerl&nbsp;telepathically sending&nbsp;directions from Aligor.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">WEIRD</span> <span class="caps">TOMB</span>&nbsp;<br>
After half a day of following Aligor's&nbsp;directions south, the party comes across a strange, slowly rotating inverted pyramid of black stone hovering an inch above the cavern floor – perhaps a lost Netherese tomb like that of Brysis of Khaem. It is thirty feet high, and sixty feet across at its "base" (the top). Yzak&nbsp;flies to fhe flat top and investigates the trap door entrance there without waiting for Zap to investigate for traps, but withstands the curse directed against him when he does. In the large upper chamber, Zap and Yzak&nbsp;find an ornate sarcophagus. This time Yzak&nbsp;does investigate first, but finds that it is no sarcophagus at all – the sculpture comes to life as a stone golem! Meanwhile, through the trapdoor down into the middle level comes a swirling whirlwind of dust that consolidates into a powerful mummy lord.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/885719/MummyLord.jpg?1533233546"><br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/885721/Stone_golem.jpg?1533233939"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Though the imposing form of the stone golem hulks behind them, its crushing fists prove unable to often strike home thanks to the watchful guard of Yzak&nbsp;the cavalier. The party meanwhile focuses their assault on the mummy lord, which attacks them with dreadful glare, rotting fist, blasphemous word, spiritual weapon, and blinding dust. Though sometimes able to blind or stun the heroes, the mummy never hits with its slamming fists, and thus cannot subject the heroes to the accursed disease of mummy rot. The Zhent agent Aligor&nbsp;Moonwhisper&nbsp;- the only one of the group to know the way to Mantol-Derith, and a much lesser fighter than any of the heroes – is told to stay back and not engage.&nbsp;Zimmerl hovers above the pyramid roof, mystically blasting down into the melee, while Jagh&nbsp;(in earth elemental form)&nbsp;melds through the stone to rise upward. His elemental tremorsense is useful to continue targeting the mummy lord despite blinding sand. Soon enough, the tomb's lord falls, the final blow&nbsp;dealt by the Booming Blade of Zap Rowsdower. As the mummy lord falls, the pyramid begins to shudder and crumble. Yzak&nbsp;flies out at once upon Vesper, but Zap darts down a level, where he sees not only gold filigree on the true tomb of the mummy lord, but also a jade scarab on a dais. Dashing through the falling debris, the rogue grabs at this talisman – only to find that it is but an illusion. Tasting his own medicine of arcane trickery, Zap leaps into the open sarcophagus, desperate for any shelter against the collapsing structure. Zimmerl, still hovering above in support of his comrade, places a telekinetic barrier up just in time to cover the open sarcophagus. Zap clearly sees the ceiling above fall and shatter against the barrier. Meanwhile Jagh has melded through the floor, finding the small lower level of the pyramid to be filled with sand – obscuring the true jade scarab. Jagh and his loaned shield guardian clear the rubble, finding Zap unharmed in the wreckage. The gnome quickly identifies the scarab as a (heavily-depleted) Scarab of Protection, still retaining its general defense against magic, but having only one charge left to defend the wearer against even a failed save.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 158 – Kythorn 25&nbsp;<br>
The party travels&nbsp;beneath the earth, descending from the Upper Northdark&nbsp;to the Middle.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">HEZROU</span> <span class="caps">STRIKE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Day 159 – Kythorn 26<br>
Two days after setting out from Blingdenstone, Jagh is scrying&nbsp;on the expeditionary force when he sees that they are lying low&nbsp;from some unseen threat as they huddle hidden on a ledge accessible only via a rope ladder. Jimjar meanwhile writes that his scouting Zhentilar&nbsp;have spotted a hezrou demon ahead, but were able to return unseen with the report. As the force waits for the demon to wander away, the heroes decide to teleport in and eliminate it. Yzak&nbsp;finds a handy landmark – a chalk graffito, reading in Orcish&nbsp;"Krusk&nbsp;was here!", and engages his Helm of Teleportation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Instructing their troops to stand back and watch, the heroes set up an ambush at a chokepoint in the tunnels. Zimmerl&nbsp;fires first as the hezrou&nbsp;wanders into view, the enraged demon running forward into his fellows' deadly waiting blades. The demonic shock trooper is dispatched without a sweat by the seasoned heroes, emboldening their allied soldiers and impressing them with the party's power. Before teleporting back, Yzak&nbsp;gives a speech to the troops, telling them to engage any lone demon they can take, or else withdraw to the last outpost they raised.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Day 160 – Kythorn 27&nbsp;<br>
The heroes traverse the twisting tunnels of the Deepearth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 161 – Kythorn 28<br>
While taking his daily Scry upon Jimjar's&nbsp;force as they march toward the Wormwrithings, Jagh sees that the expedition has come upon a ruined deep gnome village of small rounded stone huts blending into the cavern they occupied. Whether it was destroyed by the rampaging demonic host or by some earlier native cataclysm of the Underdark, the troops sift through the wreckage and find three Potions of Healing and a Driftglobe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Chapter Ten: Mantol-Derith&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ENTERING</span> <span class="caps">MANTOL</span>-<span class="caps">DERITH</span><br>
&nbsp;Day 162&nbsp;- Kythorn 29<br>
On their sixth day of travel, as the party comes to a subterranean rift with a rough-hewn path carved into one wall, their&nbsp;Zhent&nbsp;guide Aligor&nbsp;Moonwhisper&nbsp;simply stops and says "We're here." When the half-elf mentions that he didn't bring them here via the fastest route "for security reasons", Yzak&nbsp;says that if the Zhent&nbsp;ever wastes his time again, Aligor will be dead. Aligor&nbsp;approaches the cavern wall, saying "im'yat" (a svirfneblin word meaning "darkness"), and a 10-foot square of the "natural" stone wall slides aside. Reminding the heroes of his utility, the&nbsp;Zhent tells his companions that there are other secret doors around Mantol-Derith, and he knows where each one is, in addition to the passwords required to not receive a Disintegrate spell as one attempts entry. As they approach the main cavern, Aligor&nbsp;tells them of the three covenants that have long governed Mantol-Derith: that theft, the disguise of trade goods, and the magical influence of negotiation are all strictly banned. The four cartels each maintain enforcers who back these "laws" with the simple threat of death: no employer loyalty is expected or given for violators, who are chained up and thrown into the nearby Darklake.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/923707/Mantol-meeting.PNG?1543829733"><br>
<br>
<br>
Following a fairly long passage, Aligor&nbsp;leads the heroes to one of these other secret doors, saying "belaern", a drow word meaning "wealth." Again the magical door allows them to pass. Soon thereafter they find themselves in a fifty-foot deep trench which seems to bisect the outpost. A shattered platform of crystal sits in the middle of the trench. Aligor&nbsp;says this was used to lift caravans up to the marketplace, but has not been informed that it has been broken. In its place there is a system of four winch-powered lifts, easily operable by a lever mechanism. Jagh casts Mending a few times but decides that the platform will still need to be re-enchanted even if repaired, and thus the group occupies the northeastern mechanical lift and heads up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">DUERGAR</span>&nbsp;vs <span class="caps">SVIRFNEBLIN</span><br>
Coming up into the main cavern, the heroes find the east marketplace is in chaos – market stalls have been overturned, while giant lizards, steeders, and a dozen deep gnomes lie dead. Two enlarged duergar&nbsp;chase after two Blurred svirfneblin, while a third svirfneblin clutching a pale bag hides in the wreckage of a zurkhwood stall. The heroes, not knowing why Mantol-Derith's longstanding peace has been broken, at first hesitate on which side to support, speaking to the nearby gnome with the bag, whose name is Peebles. He&nbsp;says that he is not part of the Blingdenstone&nbsp;delegation, but a simple traveler interested in aberrations.&nbsp;Zimmerl&nbsp;telepathically contacts the duergar, forcing them to reveal why they are attacking the gnomes – they say that one of the svirfneblin, a Yantha Coaxrock (whom the heroes know to be the leader of Blingdenstone's Stoneheart Enclave), has stolen a valuable gem from a duergar merchant and refused to return it. The heroes lay into the duergar anyway, preferring the svirfneblin&nbsp;as allies. The duergar continue their onslaught, hitting the gnomes despite their Blur spells and dealing grievous wounds with their warpicks.&nbsp;Jagh, fighting from giant lizard-back with his drow shortsword Spider's Web, knocks out both of the enlarged gray dwarves. Meanwhile Zimmerl&nbsp;telekinetically grasps one of the svirfneblin, as Yzak&nbsp;directs Vesper to grapple another and fly into the air, stopping the gnomes to demand what they know. The wounded svirfneblin, running for their lives as their kin lie dead, tell the heroes to hurry and help: for reasons unknown, the duergar&nbsp;are trying to smash into the svirfneblin&nbsp;warehouse even now, and have captured the mage Yantha&nbsp;Coaxrock.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, looking past the wild fungal grove at the entry to the svirfneblin&nbsp;enclave, the heroes see four enlarged duergar&nbsp;battering large stone double doors. Given a little time, the gray dwarves will beat down&nbsp;the gate and storm the enclave within. The heroes do not allow this. As they approach, Vesper senses eight more invisible duergar&nbsp;waiting to follow their fellows through the breach. Zap approaches anyway, trying to treat with the belligerent gray dwarves. The invisible duergar&nbsp;raise picks and javelins as they fade into the visible spectrum, trying to threaten the rogue away. Combat ensues as the armed duergar see that the heroes mean to intervene. Zimmerl is able to blast several with hurricane-force winds, killing half of them before melee is joined. Blinded by Dawnbringer, the duergar soldiers cannot stand before the heroes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As Peebles hangs back (along with Aligor and the shield guardian), the two other surviving svirfneblin&nbsp;open the damaged doors to the svirfneblin&nbsp;warehouse, where twenty-two deep gnomes await with pickaxes and poisoned darts, ready to fight from a series of crystal platforms magically moving along the excated sides of the one-hundred foot tall warehouse. The enclave's leader, Gabble Dripskillet, is immensely thankful to the heroes for killing the duergar at their door, and in gratitude she uses command words to direct her crystal platform to a unremarkable spot on the wall, where she accesses a hidden panel. From the coffer within she draws a black sapphire pendant on a silver chain and tosses it to the heroes. This jewelry is worth 5,000 gp. Just as valuable to the gnomes is the news that the two duergar in the east market are still alive. The vengeful svirfneblin&nbsp;swarm out of their enclave to deal death to the two unconscious duergar. Meanwhile Zimmerl demands to see what is in Peebles's bag of stitched quaggoth hide; the gnome readily reveals what appears to be basic traveling provisions.&nbsp;<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/890809/Peebles.PNG?1534309765"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">BRINGING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FIGHT</span> TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DUERGAR</span>&nbsp;<br>
Crossing the&nbsp;eastern marketplace, Vesper again senses invisible duergar – four of them standing guard in the tidy rows of their fenced-in fungal grove. Zimmerl&nbsp;contacts them mentally, saying they easily dispatched their comrades attacking the svirfneblin enclave and threatening to do the same to those left to guard their base. The four duergar&nbsp;attack, launching javelins at the airborne heroes as four more join the fracas from their post by the duergar warehouse door. Again blinded by the sunlight of Yzak's&nbsp;magical blade, the duergar&nbsp;hurl their javelins to little effect against the elusive heroes, and are quickly cut down, especially when Jagh&nbsp;casts Ice Storm on the rear rank, moving in to finish off the survivor with his permanent potion-granted flame breath as the duergar&nbsp;stumbles through the hailstone-strewn ground. Across the trench in the western market, a single dark elf lounges on a bench beneath the "pavilion" of a zurkhwood mushroom cap in the drow enclave's fungi grove, the twenty-foot tall fungus splashed by water falling from the ceiling high above. A party of four other drow&nbsp;stand in the Zhentarim encampment (the Zhents having cleared away their fungal grove), beneath an actual pavilion. With the phosphorescent fungal light of the cavern magnified many times by the semiprecious stones lining the cavern wall, the drow&nbsp;and the heroes can clearly see one another across the trench, and regard each other with more than casual interest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DUERGAR</span> <span class="caps">WAREHOUSE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Opening the unlocked duergar&nbsp;doors, the heroes find thirty gray dwarf merchants and a dozen male steeders used as pack animals. The dwarves did not hear the skirmish outside thanks to the thick stone doors, and their spokesman believes Zimmerl&nbsp;when the drow&nbsp;claims that he came here to help interrogate the prisoner Yantha Coaxrock with the devious tricks of his cruel race. This spokesman, Harbek Henstak, is further delighted by Zimmerl's bluff that the heroes saw the duergar guards overrun the svirfneblin enclave, and&nbsp;eagerly directs the heroes toward a 20-foot high stone building standing within the warehouse's northeast corner. Zap readily plays along in the role of a dumb slave, adding to the deception.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Harbek&nbsp;ushers the heroes inside and leaves them to gather intelligence from the accursed gnome. Within is a storage room containing a plethora of finely-crafted metalworks and thirty casks of Darklake Stout. Here, the chief duergar negotiator&nbsp;Ghuldur Flagonfist&nbsp;grasps a rope, holding the bound and upside-down Yantha&nbsp;via a pulley system from the ceiling. Ghuldur&nbsp;and his friend&nbsp;Krimgol Muzgardt&nbsp;have dressed Yantha in a gem-encrusted gown, and&nbsp;demand that the mage divulge the location of the black gem she stole from Krimgol, or else Ghuldur&nbsp;will release his grasp and drop Yantha&nbsp;into the waiting, hungry mouth of Ghuldur's pet xorn. Yantha, meanwhile, is spinning a tale of how the drow must have charmed her and stolen the gem themselves.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The two duergar&nbsp;are surprised at the heroes' presence, but are not spoiling for a fight. While they demand the heroes' business, Zap quietly uses Mage Hand to tie a knot into the rope holding Yantha so that when it is released she will only drop a few inches. As Zimmerl dazzles them with conversation, Zap uses Mage Hand again, hovering their newly-gained black sapphire pendant directly behind Ghuldur's head. With such a tempting morsel dangled nearby, the slavering xorn&nbsp;leaps at the pendant. Though Zap pulls the jewelry back just in time to avoid the elemental's snapping jaws, the monster's master is not so lucky: Ghuldur&nbsp;is horribly wounded as his pet's powerful maw closes on his torso. Though Yantha falls as Flagonfist&nbsp;releases his grip, thanks to Zap it is only a short drop.&nbsp;Ghuldur&nbsp;is quickly finished off, and Krimgol&nbsp;swiftly follows suit. Lethal force is applied both times. Meanwhile the gem-studded dress is used to distract the xorn; as it feasts upon this banquet the party destroys the elemental creature&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;Though with Ghuldur dead the combination of the half-ton safe in one corner is lost, the peerless thief Zap is able to crack his way in, plundering a&nbsp;cloak of the manta ray, a potion of hill giant strength, and an immovable rod. Yzak then teleports the safe itself back to Plowfuddle, no doubt surprising the New Burrow Warden stewards.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The freed Yantha, when the heroes ask why she stole Krimgol's gem, gives them the same answer she supplied the duergar. When mystically compelled toward the truth by Zimmerl, however, the mage changes her tune, confessing that she gave it to her apprentice Flink Thunderbonk. Under further questioning, Yantha says that Krimgol had paid her to appraise the&nbsp;black gemstone, and at that point she lied, saying it was worthless. She offered a lump of gold in exchange, whereupon Krimgol&nbsp;suspected treachery and demanded the gem's return. While Krimgol and Yantha&nbsp;argued, her apprentice Flink&nbsp;surreptitiously took the gem elsewhere. Piecing together what they have been told by the other duergar and svirfneblin, the heroes determine that Krimgol&nbsp;then got reinforcements from his friend Ghuldur,&nbsp;invisibly invading&nbsp;the svirfneblin&nbsp;enclave and capturing Yantha for questioning. Other svirfneblin&nbsp;then tried to free the mage, leading to the first of several armed confrontations. Flagonfist&nbsp;finally sent his guards to storm the neighboring enclave and wipe out the deep gnomes, which is where the heroes entered the equation. When shown their new black sapphire pendant, Yantha says that is not the same gem, saying the one she took from Krimgol&nbsp;was the size of a human fist.&nbsp;When asked <strong>why</strong> she stole the gem, Yantha simply – and truthfully – says that she was compelled to.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Exiting the storeroom, the heroes are asked by Harbek&nbsp;Henstak&nbsp;how the interrogation went. Zimmerl&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;that the chief negotiator&nbsp;Ghuldur Flagonfist, the ale merchant Krimgol&nbsp;Muzgardt, and all of the duergar guards have been slain, and that&nbsp;Yantha Coaxrock&nbsp;is rescued. The surviving duergar merchants, Zimmerl&nbsp;says, must now serve the heroes. Harbek is incredulous, but then Yzak reveals that he is the great fugitive wanted by the Wyrmsmith Themberchaud, and convinces the overawed merchant to declare for the Deepking, switching the allegiance of the Mantol-Derith enclave to the royalist cause of the Deepkingdom Civil War. Though Harbek&nbsp;cannot send wealth across the Darklake&nbsp;due to Themberchaud's&nbsp;earlier recall of the duergar&nbsp;merchant fleet to Gracklstugh, Yzak instructs him to set aside 10% of their profits to funnel toward Horgar V's loyal lairds. Presented with a way forward that allows them both to survive and to return to their traditional Steelshadow monarch, the guard-less duergar&nbsp;promise to maintain their trade in the name of Clan Velkynvelve's new interest in the duergar strife. To ensure their safety – and, more importantly, loyalty – Yzak teleports&nbsp;to Jimjar's expeditionary force, still&nbsp;days from the Wormwrithings, and brings an eight-strong squad back with him to assign to the enclave. To avoid conflicts of interest in Mantol-Derith, none&nbsp;are Zhentarim.&nbsp;<br>
With the svirfneblin saved and the duergar&nbsp;slain or subverted, the eastern&nbsp;marketplace is subdued. To investigate the matter of this mysterious black gem at the heart of the outpost's troubles,&nbsp;&nbsp;the heroes&nbsp;will have to visit the western enclaves of the drow and Zhentarim.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ABERRATION</span>-<span class="caps">FANCIER</span>&nbsp;<br>
The deep gnome Peebles, still in the eastern marketplace with Aligor Moonwhisper and the shield guardian, refuses to stay with his own race's enclave,&nbsp;instead stating his wish to visit the drow&nbsp;and Zhentarim to sell them information about the duergar-svirfneblin&nbsp;conflict. He also states his value as an expert Underdark guide, and though he does not know the way to Gravenhollow, he knows someone in Mantol-Derith who can get them there. Also knowing of Ghazrim DuLoc, the heroes are unimpressed.&nbsp;</p>

Day 162 – Kythorn 29 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
A <span class="caps">CALL</span> TO…<span class="caps">HESITANT</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span>&nbsp;<br>
With the party still in the duergar enclave, the svirfneblin mage Yantha&nbsp;Coaxrock&nbsp;makes esoteric gestures with a short piece of fine copper wire, speaking arcane syllables as she casts the Sending spell. Moments later, she exclaims that her apprentice&nbsp;Flink&nbsp;Thunderbonk is trapped in the drow&nbsp;enclave – the heroes have to rescue him! The heroes, rather than urgently leap toward the supposed crisis, spend a couple of minutes trying to determine if she might be lying. The mage says that Flink didn't say much more than that, but he sounded scared.&nbsp;Yantha is agitated when Zimmerl&nbsp;suggests she leave "their" enclave (that she was abducted to), saying she will be more than happy to oblige.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">SOLAUFEIN</span> <span class="caps">JOINS</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">PARTY</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Re-emerging into the damp, chilly main grotto of the trade hub, the&nbsp;heroes see that the western marketplace stalls, tents, and pens stand empty, the merchants having​​​​​&nbsp;retreated to their&nbsp; enclaves with their goods and livestock. The male dark elf lounging in the drow fungi grove is still on his bench, but the four female drow&nbsp;in the Zhentarim&nbsp;encampment have observed the eastern battle to its conclusion, and have just entered the huge Zhental pavilion.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Crossing the trench bisecting Mantol-Derith&nbsp;via a stone bridge, the party is headed toward the lounging drow when a stranger steps out of one of the huge hollowed-out zurkhwood mushrooms: Solaufein&nbsp;is clearly of tielfling ancestry, saying that he is a refugee from the chaos in&nbsp;Gracklstugh who is searching for the reason he gained his sorcerous power. Intrigued that he could survive the trip from Gracklstugh alone, Yzak&nbsp;asks for a display of this arcane might. Solaufein&nbsp;casts Shape Water on a nearby rill. Convinced of his ability and satisfied with his intentions, the heroes welcome Solaufein into the party – though they mention nothing of their part in making modern Gracklstugh.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ZILCHYN</span> Q'<span class="caps">LEPTIN</span>&nbsp;<br>
Approaching the lone seated male&nbsp;drow, the party meets Zilchyn&nbsp;Q'Leptin, or "Zilch". Getting closer to him, they see that the entire left side of his body, including his face, has been scarred by acid.&nbsp;Trained in wizardry at the tower of Sorcere in Menzoberranzan, Zilch recently lost his eldritch might along with his spellbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jagh, who owes his life to kuo-toan hospitality, takes umbrage at the purple bag of stitched kuo-toa skin that Zilch carries his worldly goods within, but the party is interested in the hand-drawn Underdark map that Zilch has within it. Though it does not show the way to Gravenhollow, the map does depict the shortest routes from Mantol-Derith&nbsp;to Menzoberranzan, Gracklstugh, and most importantly the Wormwrithings.&nbsp; In the spirit of this trading post, the heroes offer a spellbook that they happen to have on hand: <em>Underland Magick&nbsp;</em>by the svirfneblin<em>&nbsp;</em>archmage&nbsp;Lesla Carrowil. Yzak&nbsp;says that the trade balance here heavily favors Zilch, so the party asks him to hand over a couple of oddities from within his bag: an extremely powerful magnet in the shape of a stylized spider, as well as shoes that fit anyone who wears them, but leave seemingly random prints.&nbsp; Luckily for Zilch, he can read Gnomish.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">FLINK</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">THUNDERBONK</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the heroes wrap up their negotiation with the drow&nbsp;wizard, a deep gnome runs toward them frantically, having been hiding&nbsp;against a nearby pillar of stone: it is Flink&nbsp;Thunderbonk, Yantha&nbsp;Coaxrock's apprentice they have come here to rescue. Flink rushes in a panic, babbling about a stolen gem. Calming him down, the heroes determine that Yantha&nbsp;had entrusted Flink with a large black gemstone, and that he had then come to the drow enclave to buy an eyelash encased in gum arabic – the component for an Invisibility spell – "knowing" that's what Yantha would want him to do. But before he could complete the task, a gargoyle snatched the gem from Flink's hands. He is now terrified that his mistress will be angry with him for losing the gem. He has been "trapped" in the drow&nbsp;fungi garden for hours since.&nbsp;Flink&nbsp;has been spying on the gargoyles guarding the drow enclave (indicating the ledges above), but has determined that the gem-thief is not among those currently here. Yzak admonishes Flink&nbsp;not to spy on anyone else, and has Vesper grab the mageling, and, against his protesting cries, flies him back to the svirfneblin&nbsp;enclave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">APPROACHING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DROW</span>&nbsp;<br>
With Zilch escorting them, the two female elite warriors guarding the warehouse door&nbsp;grudgingly allow the party within the drow enclave, despite being accompanied by a mere male. As the guards&nbsp;swing open the&nbsp;double stone doors, the heroes see two more female elite guards, plus nine quaggoth slaves, six giant lizards fitted with saddles, and eighteen common drow merchants. The thirty-foot high ceiling is thick with webs concealing a dozen giant spiders. The party is quick to ask if, as the new masters of the duergar&nbsp;enclave, they might treat with the chief negotiator here, but they are told that the head of the drow cartel, Sirak Mazelor, has gone to hold palaver with the Zhentarim. Two of the elite guards escort the heroes from the drow warehouse to the Zhentarim&nbsp;encampment.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/923705/Mantol-Derith.PNG?1543829568"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ZHENTARIM</span> <span class="caps">ENCAMPMENT</span>&nbsp;<br>
Coming to the huge pavilion where Ghazrim DuLoc&nbsp;conducts business beneath the many waterfalls of Mantol-Derith, the heroes find the drow&nbsp;wizardress Sirak&nbsp;Mazelor along with three of her female elite warriors, awaiting audience with the Zhentarim. There is a table covered with food and wine, but the drow refuse to partake. Sirak&nbsp;turns on the heroes as they enter the pavilion, demanding they leave at once. When they do not, she and her guards attack. One of the guards, actually a shadowblade assassin in warrior guise named Kinyel Druu'giir, slashes through the pavilion wall as she slides across the banquet of the table. Zap gives chase.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sirak&nbsp;Mazelor is an accomplished arachnomancer, but her arcane powers are wasted as Zap off-handedly casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter on her as he pursues Kinyel&nbsp;Druu'giir&nbsp;out into the Zhentarim&nbsp;camp. The two guards who had escorted the heroes from the drow enclave start behind the party, flanking with their comrades within the pavilion. The party's capabilities, however, have improved to such a degree since escaping Velkynvelve that facing fighters trained to the standards of the Academy of Menzoberranzan&nbsp;is no longer a threat. Solaufein&nbsp;showcases a few spells, such as Enemies Abound (confusing one of the warriors into regarding her comrades as foes), while Jagh&nbsp;rises from the ground, still in earth elemental form, joining his borrowed shield guardian in slamming the drow with heavy fists.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/890800/Kinyel_Druu_giir.PNG?1534308712"><br>
<br>
Meanwhile, outside the tent, Zap and Kinyel fight a desperate roguish duel. Zap has trouble landing a hit, but the drow&nbsp;shadowblade's&nbsp;poisoned sword lands multiple times. As she conjures shadow, sometimes teleporting between patches of darkness, she seems able even to pour this pure summoned shadow into Zap's very soul, necrotically&nbsp;draining his life essence. Zap is the only one in any true danger as the other heroes slowly wear down the elite warriors and the chief negotiator Sirak&nbsp;rolls hysterically on the cavern floor. Confusion is added as a gargoyle swoops down to attack Zap, seemingly in a passion to defend the assassin.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ENTER</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ZHENTS</span>&nbsp;<br>
Opening the double doors of the Zhentarim&nbsp;warehouse is a well-dressed noble – Ghazrim DuLoc – along with six thugs and a scarred beholder missing four of its eyestalks! DuLoc&nbsp;directs his men to attack the drow, and they fell one of the warriors with a volley of their heavy crossbows before charging in. Meanwhile the maimed beholder, Lorthuun, fires its eye rays in aid of Zap. Kinyel, seeing this foe appear, takes an especial interest in this aberration and moves to attack Lorthuun. By this time Yzak has cut his way through the melee to join Zap outside, and his mastery of the battlefield prevents the assassin from making her move. Lorthuun&nbsp;uses his telekinetic eye ray to raise Kinyel into the air and blast her with fear and enervation rays.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Inside the tent, the drow fighting-maids begin to fall. The Harper shield guardian smashes the skull of a prone warrior, with the remaining two dying on their feet as the Zhentilar&nbsp;mercenaries join the tide of the heroes. Sirak Mazelor&nbsp;finally snaps out of the hideous laughter, but the fight is already lost. Outside the tent, the assassin Kinyel&nbsp;is slain, along with her gargoylish would-be avenger. The beholder Lorthuun nags Ghazrim DuLoc&nbsp;into joining melee, the noble wielding his rapier with the amateurish skill of a dilettante.&nbsp;With Sirak's&nbsp;spells failing&nbsp;against the heroes, she transforms into giant spider form, and is able to kill two of the Zhent thugs with her bite and poisonous touch before succumbing to the heroes' blows.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Finding no gemstone upon or within the destroyed gargoyle, Yzak happens upon the black gemstone as he searches the body of Kinyel Druu'gir. As he touches it, the kobold succumbs to madness: he now will never let anyone know the truth of his actions or intentions, even if doing so would be beneficial to him. Zap is the only person who notices Yzak pocket the gem, and rather than let it slide the rogue casts Mage Hand, slipping the stone&nbsp;into his own hand&nbsp;and in turn falling prey to delusion: he will now&nbsp;convince himself that things are true, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As Aligor&nbsp;Moonwhisper, Zilchyn&nbsp;Q'leptin, and Peebles approach from their safe vantage point in the drow fungi garden, Peebles is instantly fascinated by Lorthuun, studying and admiring the beholder. He impatiently asks the party to be on their way, forgetting his intent to inform the Zhents&nbsp;of the duergar-svirfneblin&nbsp;conflict in his fascination of aberrations. The heroes say they have some business to conduct before leaving for Gravenhollow, and the gnome busies himself with sketching Lorthuun. The eye tyrant does not mind this lesser being's admirations.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">TREATING</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">GHAZRIM</span> <span class="caps">DULOC</span><br>
Seeing that the heroes travel with a Zhentilar&nbsp;soldier of their own, Ghazrim&nbsp;addresses Aligor Moonwhisper as he approaches the western marketplace, leaning in close. The noble satisfied with the thug's response to the Zhentarim&nbsp;passphrase, DuLoc&nbsp;invites the heroes into the warehouse to discuss their business over food and wine. As the surviving&nbsp;Zhentilar&nbsp;troops serve the heroes – including something called whiskey – the heroes explain that the Zhentarim, among other surface world factions, are sponsoring the heroes' fact-finding mission to gain the lore needed to defeat the demon lords. To achieve this goal, at the suggestion of Bruenor Battlehammer, they mean to find the library of Gravenhollow, which they have been told Ghazrim&nbsp;can held them do. The mad Yzak&nbsp;(who introduces himself as Bimbap) and Zap say a few strange things, but nothing to tip off their comrades of their conditions.&nbsp;Convinced of their errand, DuLoc&nbsp;removes his ring,&nbsp;a star ruby mounted on a golden band, which Zap recognizes as the holy symbol of Callarduran Smoothhands, the patron deity of the svirfneblin&nbsp;whose blessings the party bears. Ghazrim says that the ruby's star-shaped core will act as a magical compass, automatically pointing its bearer toward the shortest safe&nbsp;route to Gravenhollow. He&nbsp;seems to know nothing about the black gemstone that everyone else in the outpost seems to be fighting over, so the party sees no need to show it to him. He does seem pleased that it might be a black sapphire, favored gemstone of the Lord of Darkness, and a sign of Bane's approval.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/890801/Ghazrim_DuLoc.PNG?1534308909"><br>
<br>
Telling Zimmerl&nbsp;that he can tell the drow&nbsp;is likewise of noble bearing, he discreetly invites the mystic to join him in his private quarters, away from the common rabble, for some choicer whiskey. Within, Zimmerl sees Ghazrim's&nbsp;morbid collection of tiny, strange creatures preserved in pickle jars. The two agree that the Zhentarim enclave and the duergar enclave (now doing business in Clan Velkynvelve's name) should cooperate to manipulate the Mantol-Derith&nbsp;economy, and decide to leave the uncouth details of business&nbsp;to those of lesser dignity. Furthermore, they agree that the drow enclave should not be wiped out to avoid the wrath of House Baenre&nbsp;- but that perhaps in the future Zimmerl might be able to manipulate an ally of his within Menzoberranzan&nbsp;into being named head of the drow&nbsp;enclave.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Meanwhile, in the common area, Jagh&nbsp;calls to his old half-orcan manners and bluntly asks Lorthuun&nbsp;how he got his scars. The beholder uncomfortably relates how he lost several eyestalks and was badly scarred by the claws and breath weapon of a behir before excusing himself to return to guard duty, noting that he often disapproves of Ghazrim's&nbsp;choices of dinner guests. Zap has an inner monologue as he hears an unfamiliar voice in his thoughts reminding him that as a Harper, perhaps he should infiltrate and sabotage this cell of the Zhentarim. The voice quotes Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale who helped found the society, saying "the soft caress moves more than the brutal fist."&nbsp;</p>

Day 162 – Kythorn 29 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
Resting for several hours after fighting the drow&nbsp;and negotiating with Ghazrim DuLoc, the heroes make their way to the drow enclave, with Zimmerl and the drow mage Zilchyn Q'leptin leading the way. The female guard speaking to them through an eye-slit in the stone door doesn't believe their claims that Sirak&nbsp;Mazelor&nbsp;sent them on any business here, but is unable to resist Zimmerl's mental compulsion to open the warehouse all the same. Her fellow guard curses and draws her sword. The elite warriors land a couple of flesh wounds on the heroes, but the blinding sunlight of Dawnbringer&nbsp;causes them to squint and fumble. A bold male merchant casting Faerie Fire fails to even the odds, and a giant spider on the ceiling misses with its launched webbing. The spider is destroyed by a force blast from Zimmerl&nbsp;that injures the warriors, who are quickly dispatched. Zilch, not having had time to prepare spells, does not partake in combat.&nbsp;The male merchant, named&nbsp;Tsabrak Pharn, uses his drow ability to Levitate, rising twenty feet into the air to avoid the party's blades. With seventeen other merchants taking cover and preparing their poisoned crossbows and Darkness spells while nine quaggoth slaves and eleven giant spiders stand ready to join melee, the combatants stand at an impasse. In this sudden lull, Zimmerl addresses Tsabrak, claiming to be a noble of House Do'Urden. The mystic sage says that Tsabrak&nbsp;can remain alive as the new drow chief negotiator if he will relinquish any magic items in the enclave. Tsabrak&nbsp;readily agrees, showing the party to one of the stone storage builldings. The heroes are disappointed in the paltry scrolls and potion offered by Tsabrak, but the merchant reminds them that this outpost exists mainly to trade bare essentials for life in the resource-scarce Underdark, not as a bustling bazaar of powerful enchantments. At any rate, Sirak&nbsp;never told him of any other items here. As a further concession to avoid Zimmerl's&nbsp;wrath, Tsabrak&nbsp;throws in several valuable vials of exotic perfume. Zap searches the room, finding no hidden compartments or doors – though he does find a Glyph of Warding on the door that did not trigger when Tsabrak&nbsp;opened it. Deciding not to press for further tribute, the party leaves the decimated drow&nbsp;enclave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Returning to the Zhentarim encampment, the heroes sift through the corpses to find that of Sirak&nbsp;Mazelor, the late chief negotiator from Menzoberranzan. Thanks to the magic of Zap's Stonespeaker Crystal, the&nbsp;dead arachnomancer reveals that she was in the Zhent pavilion to meet with Ghazrim&nbsp;DuLoc&nbsp;in good faith, intending to join forces to finish&nbsp;off the feuding duergar and svirfneblin&nbsp;enclaves, splitting Mantol-Derith between Zhents and drow. She and her guards only attacked the heroes because they would not leave the pavilion.&nbsp;When asked how best to enter the City of Spiders, Sirak&nbsp;says that since Demogorgon rampaged through the city, security has been even higher than usual, with every known approach on high alert. She does have a useful information broker, however, named Khalessa Draga, and details their rendezvous spot in the Dark Dominion – the Underdark wilderness surrounding Menzoberranzan claimed by the drow, but not part of the city proper. Yzak recognizes this name as that of the missing Lords' Alliance deep cover operative that Lord Eravien Haund&nbsp;had told them of in Gauntlgrym, but in his madness the kobold does not remind&nbsp;his comrades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ZHENTARIM</span> <span class="caps">HEIST</span><br>
Dec​​iding to put Jagh's&nbsp;earth elemental form to good use, the party has the druid slip through the bedrock, peering through the floor into each of the Zhentarim&nbsp;storage sheds. Most contain basic tools or trade goods from the surface, but one shed is filled with treasures: thousands of coins and dozens of jewels are heaped in a loose pile. After Jagh delivers his scouting report, Zap easily sneaks back into the Zhentarim&nbsp;warehouse, picking the shed's lock and avoiding its poison needle trap via Mage Hand before robbing the Zhentarim&nbsp;blind, stuffing the valuables into his Bag of Holding. In his approach to the shed, the sharp-eyed Zap notices a secret door on the western side of the warehouse, which Jagh&nbsp;investigates through the stone wall, finding that it slowly winds upwards, and has many side passages sealed off. Jagh concludes that this is a safe, direct route from&nbsp;the surface world that the Zhentarim&nbsp;have secured to their enclave here.&nbsp;Before they make good their escape, Jagh&nbsp;scratches into the wall a taunting message in Elvish, mimicking the drow script in an attempt to sow further discord in the hidden trading post.<br>
<br>
<em>The gold was here, but now it's not; the drow just took it, and now you rot.&nbsp;</em><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">SUMMONING</span> <span class="caps">SNAPDRAGON</span>&nbsp;<br>
Before resting at "their" (duergar) enclave, Jagh&nbsp;twice casts Scry. Though he disapproves of Jijmjar's use of&nbsp;a Driftglobe scavenged from the ruined deep gnome village to provide light for the human troops, he is more dismayed upon his second casting, when he cannot envision Derendil&nbsp;at all. The druid uses his prayer beads to summon a planar ally, namely Snapdragon, the very unicorn he had called just five days prior. The High Forest-dwelling fey says that he has not seen the quaggoth&nbsp;other than the one time, eight days ago. Perhaps Derendil&nbsp;and his followers reached their destination, bringing them to some other plane, beyond the scope of Jagh's divinations?&nbsp;Snapdragon&nbsp;is willing to quest after the missing quaggoth, but only for the standard sacrifice of 20,000 gold pieces for the two days it would require to get there via the Unicorn Run. The unicorn regrets that such mercenary talk is necessary given his commitment to defend his sylvan realm.&nbsp;Furthermore, Snapdragon suggests that since it would take four days to reach Derendil if he is in trouble (two for him to make the report, two for the heroes to follow up on it), perhaps they should check in on him themselves. Furthermore, if they were worried about his safety, they should have gone with him in the first place. Despite having a huge lead on their quest thanks to Yzak's Helm of Teleportation, the party says they do not have the time to check in on Derendil, and decline to pay such a large sum for Snapdragon's services.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">MORNING</span> <span class="caps">VIOLENCE</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Day 163 – Kythorn 30<br>
As the heroes, Zilch, Peebles, and the duergar&nbsp;merchants awaken, Yzak is making his morning preparations when he immediately notices that his sword of destiny, Dawnbringer, is nowhere to be found. Immediately reaching for the party's best investigative tool, Jagh casts Scry. The image revealed is of the party and the followers, huddled around the Scry&nbsp;image. The divination seems to be focused on Zilch. As the dark elf comes out of trance, Zap quickly reaches into his bag and easily finds the golden hilt of Dawnbringer. Using Mage Hand, he dangles the weapon behind Zilch's head as the drow mage bids them good morning. Zilch seems not to consider it out of sorts as the sunblade floats directly past his gaze into its rightful wielder's hands, and asks if the heroes would mind traveling a day to the west to his hidden potion stash. Zimmerl&nbsp;compels him to truthfully tell whether he stole the item, to which Zilch replies that he supposes he did. Waiting no longer, Yzak&nbsp;ignites the radiant blade and runs the thief through, the still-kneeling mage falling dead on his back, his spellbook&nbsp;clattering beside him. As the rest of the party is not at all convinced this was the moral or prudent thing to do, Zimmerl&nbsp;revivifies his fellow drow. Interrogation reveals that though Zilch has always had a bad habit of being light-fingered, his urge to steal has become irresistible since the demonic incursion began. Zilchyn&nbsp;Q'leptin is a kleptomaniac. In fact, he says he was run out of Menzoberranzan&nbsp;after a rash of spell component thefts was traced back to him. Hearing this, Zimmerl&nbsp;mystically sends restorative psychic energy coursing through his fellow drow, instantly removing Zilch's madness. Zimmerl&nbsp;iterates that any further thefts against the party will not be tolerated, but Zilch is amazed at this act of mercy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">HARPER</span> <span class="caps">SPY</span>&nbsp;<br>
Zilch thankfully leads the heroes to the south entrance to Mantol-Derith, saying "groht" to open the secret door, an archaic Dwarvish word meaning "stone." He leads them down a short passage to the pebbly shore of the Darklake. By the dark waters is pitched a small tent which glows with light from within, and from which hums a feminine voice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/890596/Harper-DangerSigil.PNG?1534227556"><br>
<br>
In the cavern wall,&nbsp;Zap spots and recognizes a secret Harper sigil which indicates danger nearby. Cautiously approaching the tent, the rogue notices several spring-loaded hunting traps surrounding it, hidden under the pebbles. Sidestepping these, Zap stealthily approaches the tent and opens its flap, finding a hooded woman with a burning torchstalk fungus. Zap says hello. Startled, the human draws a shortsword, brandishing it threateningly at the gnome, calling him "murderer." Zap, blowing his bubble pipe casually, tries to engage her in conversation to learn of her, but she does not relent in her accusations, and tells this "killer" to leave her tent at once. When she finally lunges at him with her sword, Zap quick-draws his own and bashes her in the forehead with its pommel, knocking her unconscious at once. Zap stuffs her into his Bag of Holding. Moments later, he drags the limp human female out in front of his companions. Hearing of her hysteria, Zimmerl&nbsp;restores her sanity just as he did Zilch's. The woman – Rystia Zav – says that she is a Harper spy who descended into the Underdark some two years ago to find Mantol-Derith and infiltrate the Zhentarim&nbsp;enclave there. She got lost in the depths, and has no idea how close she's come to finding what she was looking for, and has no idea how to return to the surface. Fear, loneliness, and the demonic incursion had&nbsp;driven Rystia&nbsp;mad, and until just now she had believed that everyone she met was out to kill her. She is amazed by the drow's&nbsp;act of mercy in curing her, and sincerely thankful to all the heroes. Zap furthers this thanks by gifting her with a full rundown of current events and recent history in Mantol-Derith, valuable information for her faction.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/890803/Rystia_Zav.PNG?1534309120"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BLACK</span> <span class="caps">GEM</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Now that they are outside Mantol-Derith&nbsp;and away from so many prying eyes, Zap decides to investigate the fist-sized black gemstone that he had lifted from Yzak, who had looted it from the corpse of the drow assassin Kinyel Druu'gir. Zap telepathically contacts the gem, which has been speaking to him recently, and asks if it is in illithid. It replies "How did you know?". It also, however, says that it and Zap are the same entity. In his madness, the gnome believes this voice in his head. Using his Hat of Disguise, Zap takes the appearance of a (rather short) mind flayer. Asking Zimmerl&nbsp;about his time training in psionics among "his" race, Zap receives only confusion from Zimmerl, who then does what is becoming second nature, and psionically&nbsp;restores Zap's sanity. The gnome takes the gemstone from his belt pouch, and is instantly driven insane once more – this time going into a catatonic state. As he stands motionless, Yzak&nbsp;sees him holding the stolen gem and punches the rogue in the face, taking the gem once more for himself. Zimmerl&nbsp;cures Zap once more, who then uses Mage Hand to take the gem from Yzak without touching it as Zimmerl cures Yzak, finally restoring the party's sanity.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With the gem, clearly the cause of Mantol-Derith's madness, hovering safely in midair, Zimmerl&nbsp;examines it. Despite his impressive sagacity on arcane subjects, the mystic does not recognize this perhaps unique item. Using every trick and power at his disposal, Zimmerl&nbsp;raises an intellect fortress and grasps the gem barehanded, barely withstanding its awesome enchantments.&nbsp;At this point, the entire party begins speaking with the entity of the gem, which has its own telepathic power. Though Zap had claimed it was an illithid, when Zimmerl&nbsp;attempts to coerce it mentally, he runs into a wall of mental fortitude the likes of which he has never encountered or conceived. This is something far more dreadful. Deducing that madness is caused by demon lords, Zimmerl&nbsp;asks if this being is not indeed one of the Abyssal princes. The voice attempts to skirt the issue, stating that it need not reveal its identity or motives, but eventually concedes that it is indeed the demon lord Graz'zt, the Dark Prince of Pleasure, and that he wishes to return home to his Argent Palace. Zimmerl&nbsp;immediately calls the bluff, stating that they met Graz'zt&nbsp;over three months prior at the Silken Knot, where he was not imprisoned within a gem. The voice replies that it knows they have witnessed some oddities in the timestream – perhaps this gem is from a future where Graz'zt has been sealed? Or perhaps by breaking the gem, the party frees Graz'zt to meet them in his future and their past? The voice asks the heroes to break the jewel so that he can return to his faraway home and they can be rid of the madness he has been sowing here. The party is wary that this would, in truth, release the dark lord to do battle with them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Wearying of the voice's chicanery​​, Jagh&nbsp;uses his Prayer Beads to call out to Oghma, the Binder of What is Known, asking&nbsp;the Lord of Knowledge to send one of his agents to aid them. The deity responds to this supplication, dispatching none other than Raziel, Keeper of Secrets and Angel of Mysteries. The celestial being appears first as a pure white flame, then coalesces into a burning wheel – the onlooking Zilch, Peebles, and Rystia are awestruck, and Yzak and Jagh bow in respect. The heroes ask it to pierce the voice's deceptions, and as the wheel spins in midair, many eyelike openings appear in its flames. The voice's obfuscations are powerful indeed, however, and Raziel only learns some periphery information, not the being's identity. Namely, that this is indeed a demon lord, and that while his life force is trapped within this gem, his body still lies somewhere in the Abyss. Further, the demon lord's claim that he wishes the heroes to break the gem so that he can return to the Abyss is a true one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is some debate on how to proceed, with Yzak&nbsp;suggesting they keep the gem intact in order to use it offensively to inflict madness upon their foes, or alternately to hide it in the remotest locales possible – casting it adrift in the Astral Plane, or upon the surface of&nbsp;Selûne&nbsp;(Toril's&nbsp;moon). On the other hand, the demon's cultists will search for their lord's soul wherever it may be, and though it may not be this year, decade, or even century, they would eventually release him to their own devices – whereas by returning him to the Lower Planes, where he has existed for eons, he would do no more harm there, and would no longer cause chaos like in Mantol-Derith.<br>
<br>

<br>
With the Harpers&nbsp;Yzak and Zap wanting to keep the gem intact and the elves&nbsp;Zimmerl and Jagh&nbsp;wanting to destroy it, Raziel&nbsp;attempts to further inform their decision, making the ultimate effort. The burning wheel of his form rotates so fast as to become a blazing disc, and after a few moments it sinks to the Darklake beach and becomes a pile of burning coals. For a moment the party fears that the angel has spent its essence in the effort, but Raziel's heavenly voice soon echoes forth that it has discovered the trapped being's true nature: the sealed soul belongs to a demon lord who once spent many mortal lifetimes trapped&nbsp;beneath Castle Greyhawk&nbsp;on the world of Oerth, and had taken precautions against a mortal archmage&nbsp;conjuring him against his will once again by specially crafting this black jewel, a magically protected receptacle. As soon as the demon lord felt the tug of a summoning spell when the demonic incursion began, he transferred his evil life force to the gem.&nbsp;However, the epic conjuration&nbsp;proved irresistible, and the precious gem was cast into the Underdark along with the other demon lords, while its crafter's body remained in the Abyss. This demon lord, Raziel says, is Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception, and seeing through his layers of lies and disguises has been the single most difficult deed of the angel's eternal existence. Zimmerl&nbsp;asks if keeping the&nbsp;gem intact would allow them to easily slay Fraz-Urb'luu in his Abyssal lair, but Raziel&nbsp;suggests that traveling to the Abyss with the relic would likely allow the demon lord's spark to return to his corporeal form.&nbsp;Hearing this, the party elects to destroy the gem, and Yzak&nbsp;ignites Dawnbringer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">DESTROYING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GEM</span> OF <span class="caps">FRAZ</span>-<span class="caps">URB</span>'<span class="caps">LUU</span>&nbsp;<br>
Zap calls for caution as Yzak prepares to smite the unholy jewel, warning that as Dawnbringer is a sentient weapon there may be sanity consequences of wielding her against the soul receptacle. Likewise, he votes against tossing the gem into the holy fire of Raziel, believing it would be terrible to merge the Demon Lord of Illusions with the Angel of Mysteries. The heroes ask Raziel what would happen if Dawnbringer&nbsp;were wielded against the gem, and the angel confirms that the blade would likely become darker of mien, perhaps troubled of&nbsp;mind, and more vengeful than righteous in demeanor. But ultimately, Raziel&nbsp;says, why not ask the sword itself? The sentient sunblade says that sending a lord of the tanar'ri back to the Abyss would be the ultimate achievement of its existence, and that it would willingly risk madness, destruction, or any other burden to accomplish it. Satisfied, the heroes bring their divine and psionic protections to Dawnbringer's&nbsp;defense, and Yzak&nbsp;ignites the shining blade above the ebon stone. The gemstone is obliterated, blasting shrapnel in every direction, and Dawnbringer&nbsp;briefly shines moonlight rather than that of the sun before emerging triumphant in the contest of wills. The telepathic voice of Fraz-Urb'luu thanks the heroes for sending him&nbsp;back to his Abyssal lair, the fortress of Zorag-melok. In this&nbsp;final message, the Prince of Deception suggests that he and the heroes might meet again someday…<br>

<p>In which the heroes follow up on leads from new companions met in Mantol-Derith, including Zilch's potion stash, Amarith&nbsp;Coppervein's&nbsp;menagerie, and the lair of Peebles' beholder master Xazax&nbsp;the Eyemonger.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 163 – Kythorn 30 (cont.)<br>
<span class="caps">EMERALD</span> <span class="caps">ENCLAVE</span> <span class="caps">AGENT</span>&nbsp;<br>
With Peebles offering a Darklake&nbsp;barge to make the short watery jaunt needed to go west from Mantol-Derith toward the land route to Zilch's potion stash, the heroes follow the deep gnome through the outpost's northeast entrance, speaking the password "ssussun" (the drow&nbsp;for "light") to exit unscathed.&nbsp;As the door noisily rumbles aside, the heroes see an elf with long red hair, cleaning his fine clothing with <em>prestidigitation</em> as he dangles his bare feet into the vast lake stretching before them. The elf turns, offering them a wry smile as he asks if they care to join him. Asking this elf's business, the party finds that he is one Sladis&nbsp;Vadir, a druid of the Emerald Enclave; Yzak&nbsp;furthermore recognizes this name as a scout that the Enclave representative Morista Malkin&nbsp;had lost track of some months ago, and hoped for a safe return to Gauntlgrym.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893113/Sladis_Vadir.PNG?1534921628"><br>
<br>
Convinced of their sincerity and happy to return to his order, Sladis&nbsp;gratefully opens his haversack to offer them some food in thanks – only to produce the severed hand of a drow. His pack is stuffed with the uncooked limbs and eviscerated organs of drow, svirfneblin, grimlock, and quaggoth&nbsp;victims. When no one takes his offered food, Sladis&nbsp;starts gnawing on the raw drow hand himself. The heroes, nonplused&nbsp;at this, simply ask him if this is normal behavior for him, to which Sladis replies that it is simply "culling the herd." Zimmerl&nbsp;mystically restores the druid's sanity while he is eating the hand. Sladis hurls the appendage into the vast subterranean lake in revulsion, and immediately vomits. The elf is shaken by what he has become in his wanderings, and follows the heroes in a desire for safety. Before setting out, he dumps the contents of his pack – it is a <em>Heward's handy haversack</em>, so it contains much more volume than its size would suggest, and the resulting pile of viscera is truly disgusting.&nbsp;The heroes and their new companions (Peebles, Sladis&nbsp;Vadir, Rystia&nbsp;Zav, and Zilchyn&nbsp;Q'leptin)&nbsp;go to board the barge, with the shield guardian trudging along the murky bottom of the Darklake. As they clamber onboard, the adventurers note a large patch of bloody water moving down the current toward them. Numerous dead sahuagin&nbsp;and their shark pets, along with several merrow and&nbsp;ixitxachitl, float among the gore. The more religiously-minded heroes believe that the sahuagin&nbsp;were attacked by Demogorgon's monstrous aquatic followers for their loyalty to their shark god Sekolah, the Caller from the Depths. Jagh&nbsp;briefly toys with the idea of making some overture to this distant deity of hunting and plunder, who makes his domain in Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">CYCLOPS</span> &amp; <span class="caps">CHIMERA</span>&nbsp;<br>
A couple of hours after landing their borrowed barge and setting out overland, Yzak&nbsp;is scouting ahead when he spots a mighty cyclops, running in terror from some unseen threat, crashing through stalagmites as he flees. Yzak&nbsp;returns to the party, and everyone crams into a side alcove off the tunnel, with Zimmerl&nbsp;casting <em>darkness </em>with his drow magic as the cyclops careens past. As he does, the heroes hear a terrible triple roar, sounding like that of a dragon and a great cat mixed with the bleating of a huge goat. With Zimmerl deducing that this must be a chimera, Zap peeks out of the cloud of darkness and casts <em>Tasha's hideous laughter</em>, resulting in what must be the truest result of that spell ever to grace the Underdark. The first chimerae are said to have been created by Demogorgon himself when the Prince of Demons appeared on the Material Plane in eons past and was unimpressed by the monsters around him. When Vesper grapples the beast, it breathes fire at the giant bat and its riders Yzak and Zap, while biting, goring, and clawing.&nbsp;Despite this, the party is not much threatened by this monstrosity, and soon Yzak&nbsp;(dual-wielding Dawnbringer&nbsp;along with Zap's Blade of the Lurker) decapitates the goat head, stabs the lion in the eye, and thrusts Dawnbringer&nbsp;down the throat of the draconic head.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893115/Chimera.jpg?1534923607"><br>
<br>
The cyclops has continued to flee in the meantime, and Zimmerl&nbsp;contacts the giant as it is just on the edge of his telepathic reach. The rustic, unwise giant is awed by this voice in his mind, and explains it was running from the "scary monster", and so is cowed by the power of such a hero as one who could slay a mighty chimera. Zimmerl&nbsp;says that he is many, and one, which only confuses the cyclops. Nonetheless the cyclops swears to find his way back to his lair and to devote a shrine to the worship of this great Zimmerl.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">TRAGIC</span> <span class="caps">HISTORY</span>&nbsp;<br>
On the way north, the Harper spy Rystia&nbsp;Zav casually mentions that she can't wait to return to her hometown of&nbsp;Nesmé. This town was known as a trade settlement along the road to Silverymoon, famous for defending against the trolls of the Evermoors, but only the most casual students of recent history do not know that&nbsp;Nesmé&nbsp;was razed by an orc horde three years ago during the War of the Silver Marches. Furthermore, this orc horde was led by the drow&nbsp;Tiago&nbsp;Baenre, now proclaimed Duke of&nbsp;Nesmé,&nbsp;and when forced to withdraw from the sunlit surface settlement, Tiago&nbsp;death-marched the survivors of the town into slavery in Menzoberranzan. Zimmerl, fearing Rystia&nbsp;will associate him with the crimes of House Baenre, does not speak up. Zap does inform Rystia of the fate of her homeland, but only regarding orcish conquest, not of drow leadership. Also, Zav had previously said she had been in the Underdark for some two years, but in her madness she had lost track of time, and had lost a further year of her life.&nbsp;Rystia is shaken by these revelations, but vows to return to help rebuild&nbsp;Nesmé as soon as she can.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ZILCH</span>'S <span class="caps">STASH</span>, <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CRICKET</span>-<span class="caps">CATCHER</span>&nbsp;<br>
After hours of marching, the heroes come upon a cave swarming with bats and infested with dozens of giant albino crickets the size of halflings, which feed upon the guano. A kuo-toa&nbsp;sees the heroes enter the cave, gives them a happy-go-lucky wave, and catches a cave cricket with his homespun net before bashing in its head with a nearby rock. Zilch says that he has never seen this kuo-toa before. The being introduces himself as Ougalop, and says that he is here for the good cricket hunting. Ougalop is taken aback when Yzak&nbsp;asks if he has heard of the teachings of&nbsp;Shuushar the Awakened, who says that kuo-toa&nbsp;must not take any life. Ougalop&nbsp;swears he will try to follow this credo, but he has not met this great prophet, nor returned to Sloobludop in a couple of years – and so is blissfully unaware of Demogorgon's rampage through the village. Ougalop seems uninterested in following them, and poses no threat, so the heroes leave him to find his way in the Underdark.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893127/Ougalop.PNG?1534930685"><br>
<br>
Zilch points toward a thirty-foot cliff, saying this is the old grick nest where his vaunted potion stash is hidden. Zap flies up on Vesper and investigates, finding no traps protecting the hidden treasures of three <em>potions of vitality, </em>rare items<em>&nbsp;</em>indeed.<em>&nbsp;</em>Zilch lets them have these consumables as thanks for his continued life, and for curing him of his madness.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TREACHERY</span> OF <span class="caps">PEEBLES</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
At Zilch's stash, Sladis Vadir&nbsp;swears that he has been in this very cave before, and that they are not more than a couple of hours away from his fellow Emerald Enclave member Amarith&nbsp;Coppervein, whom he would very much like to check up on. Though the party was quite ready to teleport to Gauntlgrym to be on their way toward Gravenhollow, they agree to help their new companion. As Sladis&nbsp;plots his course through the Underdark&nbsp;for the heroes to follow, Peebles chimes in, saying that this route is too dangerous, lying by a nest of purple worms. Zap immediately sees through Peebles' ruse, seeing that his fellow svirfneblin&nbsp;seeks to hoodwink them. Zimmerl, who believes Peebles, says that he will prove it, mentally compelling Peebles to tell the truth. The gnome reveals that he is the&nbsp;servant of a beholder named Xazax the Eyemonger, to whom he wishes to report the presence of the Zhentarim beholder Lorthuun in Mantol-Derith, so that Xazax&nbsp;can kill Lorthuun and add Lorthuun's eyestalks to his collection of grafts. Peebles sheepishly admits that Xazax&nbsp;would likely have tried to slay the heroes if they were to follow him to the beholder's lair, but makes no apologies, saying if the adventurers kill him that he will die in the eye tyrant's service. Likewise Peebles makes no move against them, unshakably confident in his master's ability to deal with this band of upstart humanoids. Thus Peebles goes with all the rest when the group sets out to find Amarith&nbsp;Coppervein. Meanwhile the heroes use their <em>sending stone</em> to contact their Mantol-Derith garrison, instructing the Lords' Alliance spy&nbsp;Hilvius Haever to see if Lorthuun&nbsp;is willing to pay them to destroy Xazax&nbsp;for him.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">AMARITH</span>'S <span class="caps">ZOO</span>&nbsp;<br>
Two short hours west from Zilch's stash, the adventurers come upon a cavern with a dozen hollowed-out stalagmites, their hollows barred with iron. As they enter, a dwarf-maid approaches and grandly welcomes them to pay the low price of 3 coppers a head for admission to tour the zoo – the spendthrift heroes pay 30 electrum instead, or about double the asked-for price. Amarith&nbsp;greets Sladis, having not seen him in several years, and begins the tour.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893125/Amarith.PNG?1534930660"><br>
<br>
First up is a fire snake, a creature of elemental fire captured from the environs of Gracklstugh, freshly riddled&nbsp;with gates to the Plane of Fire&nbsp;since Themberchaud declared the whole city to be his personal demesne. Jagh's&nbsp;heart is moved to see this elemental behind bars, but for now the druid holds his tongue. The second exhibit is a rust monster, which evokes little emotion in anyone present, though Zap is nervous that it might devour his prized gear if let loose. The final enclosure houses a winged kobold, or urd.&nbsp;Zap is deeply troubled that Amarith is keeping a sapient creature captive, as the urd is clearly miserable in isolation. When asked, Sladis says that when last he was here, Amarith only had a single pet: an osquip, the multi-legged rodents of the Underdark.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893128/WingedKobold.jpg?1534930870"><br>
<br>
Yzak asks Amarith if she would be amenable to selling the urd; the dwarf replies that she would of course be willing to since she is in business, and "the zoo business is tough." One kobold forks over enough gold for the other, and the cage is opened. The urd stretches his wings and says that he will be adding a syllable to his name to signify the importance of this day, and that henceforth his name is&nbsp;Molo'Varn. Unfortunately the urd is, by the party's standards, not very knowledgeable on his native Wormwrithings: he is ignorant of any kind of dark sister blade to Dawnbringer, and knows nothing of any asylum run by a mind flayer. Nonetheless, Yzak, Zap, and Jagh are pleased to have freed Molo'Varn from captivity.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yzak&nbsp;asks if Ammarith would like to join their expeditionary force in the field; the dwarf says that she would, since the Emerald Enclave has a contingent among the troops and being with them is better than being alone in the demon-infested Underdark. Immediately packing her things, she allows the ranger to teleport her to the edge of the Wormwrithings. Meanwhile she leaves the fate of her remaining charges to the heroes. Sladis&nbsp;Vadir&nbsp;follows his Emerald Enclave colleague in joining the expeditionary force, advertising his support roles of foraging, healing, and navigation. Also joining is Zilchyn&nbsp;Q'leptin, who says that since he is run out of Menzoberranzan&nbsp;he must fight under the party's banner, yet going with them to Gauntlgrym would present too much of a temptation to steal the finely-worked dwarven&nbsp;crafts. The Harper spy Rystia&nbsp;Zav (who wishes to bring Zap's report on Mantol-Derith to Gauntlgrym) and deranged svirfneblin&nbsp;Peebles remain with the heroes, along with the Harper shield guardian.&nbsp; Peebles had intended to strike out for Xazax's lair on his own, but Zimmerl&nbsp;"convinced" him to stay with the party rather than warn the beholder of their approach. Peebles, believing&nbsp;his master needs no advantage against these "lesser beings", doesn't put up much resistance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893129/Rust_Monster.png?1534930970"><br>
<br>
The fire snake's and rust monster's captivity force an unexpected moral quandary upon the heroes. Zimmerl&nbsp;telepathically contacts the fire snake, as he had the urd earlier, posing a series of philosophical questions meant to reveal the elemental's morality.&nbsp;Jagh&nbsp;is wholly for releasing the fire snake, despite it being a dim-witted and evil creature with only destruction in its heart, arguing on the grounds that elemental beings are part of the multiverse's natural order, and without a salamander present the fire snake has no master to direct its hatred. The rust monster likewise cleaves the party in two, with the naturalistic&nbsp;Jagh and Yzak&nbsp;calling to spare the creature while the callous drow&nbsp;Zimmerl and the pragmatic rogue Zap call for its destruction. Despite the objections of the rest of the party, none of them feel strongly enough to act against Jagh when he opens the fire snake's cage to set the creature free; the smoldering serpent slithers away, leaving a lowly-burning trail in its wake. Meanwhile Jagh&nbsp;consents to allow Zap to kill the rust monster, provided he give it a clean death. Releasing the monster from its cage, Zap obliges by firing an expertly-aimed crossbow bolt between its neck plates, sending it into oblivion before its brain can even register the pain.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Flamerule, "Summertide"<br>
Day 164 – Flamerule 1<br>
<span class="caps">XAZAX</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EYEMONGER</span><br>
Peebles prepares the heroes some catfish sushi for&nbsp;breakfast as they awake in Amarith's abandoned zoo, trading taunts with the party as he prepares their "last meal", though he does compliment Zap's fish beer.&nbsp;Peebles remains invincibly confident that Xazax&nbsp;will mop them up without effort or incident. After they have broken their fast, the svirfneblin&nbsp;leads them toward his master's lair.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A couple of hours later, the group comes upon a dome-shaped cavern, unremarkable save for a 20-foot wide hole in its center. Before Peebles can announce their presence, Zimmerl&nbsp;compels him into complicity in an ambush. Zap creates a small illusory bit of cover for himself to hide behind, while Zimmerl&nbsp;creates a patch of magical darkness at the cavern's entrance for himself. Jagh, in earth elemental form, submerges himself into the rock. Peebles announces his presence, shouting "Master! I've returned!", and moments later the eye tyrant hovers out of the 100-ft deep shaft. He is a&nbsp;mottled purple-gray creature, smooth-skinned, with a circular blue iris in his central eye, half the usual&nbsp;size. His eyestalks are thick and long, and&nbsp;ridged like earthworms. In addition to these ten natural stalks, Xazax's personal surgeon Peebles has grafted eight eyestalks of rival beholders onto his master's body.&nbsp;His&nbsp;teeth are a double row of thick, pointed fangs. As soon as Xazax&nbsp;emerges from his hole,&nbsp;the beholder's central eye brings its antimagic cone to bear, dispelling Zimmerl's&nbsp;<em>darkness</em> and revealing the drow mystic. Combat ensues.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/893130/Xazax.PNG?1534931561"><br>
<br>
<br>
Yzak, Zap, and Jagh&nbsp;attack with surprise against Xazax, with the former two attacking alongside&nbsp;Vesper&nbsp;as per usual. The beholder tries to withdraw to the center of the shaft to avoid melee attacks, but is held in check by the sentinel cavalier&nbsp;Yzak. Xazax&nbsp;does manage to hit Vesper with a paralysis ray, which then renders the bat unable to resist his telekinesis ray, and Vesper is dropped unceremoniously down the one hundred foot shaft. Xazax's&nbsp;central eye stays trained on Zimmerl, keeping his psionic powers suppressed in the antimagic cone. As Zimmerl waits for the moment the eye changes perspective – which never comes – the other eyestalks blast his fellow heroes. Earth-Jagh is repeatedly hit with rays that more dexterous&nbsp;party members might have dodged, primarily death or disintegration rays, taking massive damage. His shield guardian is nearly petrified. Meanwhile, eyestalk-like appendages extend from the wall of Xazax's lair, grabbing Zimmerl and holding him still, and strange eyes sometimes flicker open along the wall, firing rays of their own. Although Zimmerl&nbsp;is effectively powerless&nbsp; within the antimagic cone, by remaining away from his comrades he allows them to retain their magic weapon abilities as well as Jagh's&nbsp;<em>bless</em> spell, which helps them overcome Xazax's&nbsp;fear ray and other effects. Though he dishes out a great deal of damage, especially to Jagh, and absorbs a frightening amount of punishment himself, Xazax is ultimately overwhelmed by the party. Yzak&nbsp;deals the deathblow, raking Dawnbringer&nbsp;across Xazax's eyestalks before plunging the blade through the beholder's open mouth up into its brain. The dead aberration floats above its lair's central shaft as its minion Peebles looks on, jaw agape.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Zimmerl, having slain Peebles' "god", tries to recruit the gnome into joining his own nascent cult. But Peebles is too despondent to consider continued existence, having witnessed the impossible&nbsp;destruction of the perfect being, and leaps down the hundred-foot shaft. But Zap casts <em>feather fall</em> on Peebles at the last instant, robbing the gnome of his suicide. The unhinged servant of Xazax&nbsp;screams that he will just sit at the bottom of the shaft and starve, but after some convincing the party comforts him with the thought that perhaps he could return to Mantol-Derith&nbsp;to serve Lorthuun. Peebles dejectedly climbs out of the shaft and agrees to allow them to bring him safely there. Finally, Zap scouts the shaft upon bat-back, rummaging through the shattered remains of petrified foes that litter the bottom. Among the debris, he finds a longsword of black iron, its&nbsp;crossguard&nbsp;bearing the orange and red symbol of the Cult of Eternal Flame (one of the sects of Elemental Evil). It is a <em>flame tongue</em>, and Jagh&nbsp;girds himself with this weapon, eager to put his newly-innate elven swordsmanship to use.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As the party is about to depart Xazax's&nbsp;cavern, they receive a message on their <em>sending stone</em> from Hilvius&nbsp;Haever: that Lorthuun has declined their offered contract killing of Xazax. The party's spy believes that Lorthuun wishes to take them up on the hit, but for some reason cannot afford to hire them. The reason, of course, is that the heroes stole every coin in the Zhentarim enclave. Judging from a lack of report of violence, Jagh's attempt at forgery in the Zhent&nbsp;vault, meant to throw suspicion on the drow, did not quite work.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
Day 164 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">ROUNDABOUT</span> <span class="caps">TRIP</span> TO <span class="caps">GAUNTLGRYM</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having slain the deep gnome Peebles's master Xazax&nbsp;the Eyemonger&nbsp;and convinced him to serve the other beholder, Lorthuun, at the Zhentarim&nbsp;enclave in Mantol-Derith, Yzak&nbsp;teleports the insane svirfneblin&nbsp;back to the hidden trading post. Without checking in on anyone else there, the kobold magically cuts through space itself to return to his fellows, then teleporting them before the gates of Gauntlgrym. In the Great Cavern, the heroes spot four bipedal beings, abominable crossbreeds of human and fish, as they slip into the placid waters of a subterranean pond, crossbow bolts skipping off the stone floor as they are fired from the dwarves stationed at the guard posts carved into the cavern walls far above. Recognizing the fins twisted and grown into limbs, the bent back crowned with a spiny frill, and bulbous eyes as those of skum – the misbegotten slaves of the aboleth – Zimmerl&nbsp;telepathically contacts the skum&nbsp;and bluffs them that he is their aboleth master, commanding them to approach the shield dwarf city's gates. Slavishly obeying their aberrant lord, the skum are easily cut down by the dwarven crossbow salvos from above.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/897025/Skum.jpg?1536042607"><br>
<br>
Zimmerl&nbsp;flies up to the guard posts, finding that these dwarves have not swum into these chilled waters to explore them for threats, quite content to guard here for threats from ground or from water. In turn Zimmerl&nbsp;flies down, hovering just above the water's surface to look down with the hag-enchanted derro periscope-head, and is surprised when the water itself surges upward to try and grab him to drag&nbsp;him into the pond. In the meantime Zimmerl&nbsp;does glimpse an aboleth in the grotto below.&nbsp;The mystic luckily withstands the water's pull, and battle is on.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/897024/Aboleth.PNG?1536041878"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ABOLETH</span>'S&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAIR</span>&nbsp;<br>
Jagh&nbsp;quickly responds to the threat, dashing to the pond's edge and leaping in in killer whale form. The aboleth&nbsp;is fast to mentally enslave this physical specimen – but Yzak&nbsp;understands what is happening, and the beastmaster has Vesper bite Orca-Jagh, forcing the druid out of his enthrallment. Yzak&nbsp;and Zap swim down to join Jagh in underwater melee as Zimmerl&nbsp;floats down upon his Broom of Flying, firing off psionic&nbsp;blasts before returning to the open air. The cloud of mucous surrounding the aboleth&nbsp;infects Zap with a disease – he can only breathe water, not air – and the thicker mucous on the aberration's tentacles infects Yzak&nbsp;with an even more horrible ailment: every minute he spends outside water will burn his flesh as though by acid. Finally the heroes are able to slay the aboleth just as they did its minions, and Zimmerl&nbsp;expends much of his psionic power restoring his fellows from the aboleth's&nbsp;inflicted diseases. Zap, the sole hero who a tenday prior had observed alien energy draining the dwarves' system of wires connected to Maegera&nbsp;the Dawn Titan in the Great Forge, now observes this same eldritch power leaking from the aboleth's&nbsp;corpse, and is satisfied that one more arcane threat to mortal existence has been vanquished.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">UNDERWATER</span> <span class="caps">EXPLORATIONS</span>&nbsp;<br>
After Zimmerl&nbsp;gloats to the dwarven&nbsp;guards that there was indeed a great threat right beneath their noses, Jagh elects to explore this tunnel, this source of woe, to its end. After swimming for roughly a mile through twisting, drowned tunnels, Jagh&nbsp;turns a bend only to be confronted by some kind of fish-fiend.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/897027/Wastrilith.jpg?1536043678"><br>
<br>
Zimmerl, watching Jagh's&nbsp;progress via&nbsp;mystical sensor, is witness to this meeting, seeing the waters go red as the demon – a wastrilith – slashes at Orca-Jagh&nbsp;with its scythe-like appendages, sucking Jagh back toward it with its mouth, keeping Jagh&nbsp;in the corrupted waters around it. Orca-Jagh is barely able to break free and escape, and the wastrilith gives chase. The rest of the party, a mile away through lightless waters, rushes to meet Jagh. Yzak&nbsp;and Zap go through desperate measures, eating some of the mucous off the dead aboleth&nbsp;to deliberately contract the water-breathing disease, and holding onto ropes dragged by Zimmerl as he "flies" underwater with his magic broom.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Fleeing for hundreds of feet through the watery tunnel, barely ahead of the pursuing demon, Jagh&nbsp;sees the strange spectacle of his comrades hurrying to his rescue. After some hasty telepathic talk, Jagh&nbsp;continues on his course while the others hide in a rocky alcove. The wastrilith&nbsp;chases hungrily on, unaware of the heroes lying in ambush, and is caught perfectly in their trap. Yzak, Zap, and Zimmerl&nbsp;descend mercilessly upon the demon as Jagh&nbsp;turns back to join them, no longer the bait. Soon the wastrilith&nbsp;is destroyed. While other demons the party have&nbsp;faced have melted into a tarlike black ichor upon death as their twisted souls return howling to the Abyss, half of this fiend freezes solid and falls adrift in the water as the other half immolates in an intense flame.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">GAUNTLGRYM</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">INTERLUDE</span>&nbsp;<br>
Entering the shield dwarf city proper, the heroes set up in Clan Velkynvelve's&nbsp;apartments in the Vault of Kings, where the various faction representatives make contact regarding their quest. Sir Lanniver Strayl, who is coordinating the Order of the Gauntlet's crusade against the demons, wants to know any reconnaissance of demon pack movements or known strongholds throughout the Underdark, as well as any surface entrances that his men should secure in the Realms Above. The heroes tactfully decline to mention the Zhentarim&nbsp;tunnel from Mantol-Derith, but otherwise supply the knight with their military intelligence, including the underwater cave outside Gauntlgrym&nbsp;that had at least two dangerous monsters within. They also gift Sir Lanniver with a shard of the shattered gemstone which had housed the life force of Fraz-Urb'luu&nbsp;- something he promises to hold in trust until he can bring it to the Order's wisest clerics and monks. Lord Zelraun&nbsp;Roaringhorn&nbsp;has heard of neither Rystia Zav nor her mission to Mantol-Derith, but this is not unusual for the decentralized Harpers. He is, however, more than happy to cast a Banishment spell to store in his loaned shield guardian, and reminds Zap of their upcoming rematch in chess.&nbsp;Roaringhorn's fellow Waterdhavian noble, Lord Eravien Haund&nbsp;of the Lord's Alliance, has returned to Waterdeep. Marista Malkin is interested in reports of corrupted flora and fauna. Most interesting is Davra Jassur, the Zhentarim&nbsp;"troubleshooter", who coyly asks how they liked her smarmy Amnian&nbsp;colleague Ghazrim DuLoc. The heroes honor their promise to pay her a full share of their coin earned from Gauntlgrym to Mantol-Derith, handing over 1,215 gold pieces. The heroes, naturally, are a bit more cagey about the current state of things in the secret trading post. The party and the Zhent agent part ways more amicably than perhaps either had anticipated, with Davra&nbsp;offering her murderous services if they should ever need a certain someone eliminated.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The other personage seeking audience with the heroes here is Thiakit Thistledown, the wood elf whom Yzak&nbsp;had made acquaintance with during The Hunt. He and the other rangers of the High Forest who heeded Yzak's&nbsp;call as this year's Master of The Hunt to pursue fiends as their quarry have been scouting the deep wilds around Gauntlgrym. They have sustained a couple of casualties, but have cleared out several demon dens, and have provided invaluable scouting for the sturdy dwarven infantry. In addition to the known demonic threat and the usual Underdark&nbsp;oddities, Thiakit reports that there was an unusually strong tremor that he felt a few days to the north on his most recent ranging.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As dusk falls across the sunlit lands above the thousands of tons of rock which hang above the heroes' heads, the Mark of Maegera&nbsp;fades from the party a tenday after they had received it.&nbsp;Crossing the vast halls of the hold, the party visits the Great Forge, above where the primordial is bound. After Yzak&nbsp;futilely tries to regain the Dawn Titan's mark by grasping at the exposed and enchanted copper wires here, the kobold asks the impressed dwarven smiths if any among them could melt and reforge the <em>flametongue&nbsp;</em>longsword recently found in Xazax&nbsp;the Eyemonger's lair, folding its steel with that of&nbsp;Zap's enchanted short sword to create one singularly powerful blade. One Rollo Summergold, who recognizes Zap from Mithral Hall, says that perhaps Moradin Dwarffather himself could reforge the weapons in this way, but that he would be glad to shorten the <em>flametongue</em>'s blade so that the kobold could more readily wield it. He also replaces the jewel on the crossguard (a symbol of the Cult of the Eternal Flame) with a sigil representative of Clan Velkynvelve – an armed humanoid figure standing triumphant over a slain demon.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 165 – Flamerule 2 &nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">BACK</span> TO <span class="caps">BASICS</span><br>
Yzak starts off the day, as with so many lately, with some teleportation around the Northdark. Using his magic helm, the kobold brings Thiakit and three other High Forest rangers with giant lizard mounts to Jimjar's expeditionary force, along with the drow mage Zilchyn&nbsp;Q'Leptin, before returning to his fellows in Gauntlgrym. Joining the party's&nbsp;distant followers, Yzak finds Jimjar, Topsy, and Turvy standing upon the dead hulk of a purple worm. Quite impressed for a moment, the ranger realizes that these svirfneblin&nbsp;did not deal the deathblow to the monster barely able to fit within the smooth-bored&nbsp;tunnel they stand in – it was slain by the rage of demons. The expeditionary force, however, did come upon some gnoll scavengers picking at the gargantuan corpse along with their hyena companions, and the two forces have just finished clashing. Yzak&nbsp;wishes Jimjar the best and returns to the other heroes in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Rystia Zav leaves the party, saying that she needs to return to her fallen hometown of&nbsp;Nesmé&nbsp;to scout it out for potential liberation and rebuilding in the wake of its razing by an orcish army.&nbsp;This leaves the heroes as they have rarely been since escaping slavery in Velkynvelve – alone. Other than the four of them, their sole companion is now the Harper shield guardian. Thus do they set forth from Gauntlgrym, following Ghazrim DuLoc's&nbsp;star ruby ring north along the safest route toward Gravenhollow. There had been some attempt at triangulation while Yzak&nbsp;was with Jimjar and friends on the eastern edge of the Wormwrithings, but as the ring's magic points them to the <em>path </em>to&nbsp;Gravenhollow and not toward the library itself, this proved virtually impossible, and the company knows not how long their march might be.<br>
<br>
Day 170 – Flamerule 7&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">LORDS</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EARTH</span>&nbsp;<br>
Five days later, Yzak and Zap are aerially scouting ahead as usual when they spot a trio of beings moving in the opposite direction. Though possessed of powerful rocklike torsos, the three have no legs at all – instead being borne by a whirlwind of dust and sand. They are dao, the genies of elemental earth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/898236/Dao-5e.png?1536395985"></p>
<p>Knowing dao to be unapologetic slavers, the two Harper scouts address the genies&nbsp;and demand their business. All three tighten their grips on their great stone mauls, with one casting <em>tongues</em> to act as ambassador while another conjures an earth elemental. They live up to the heroes' expectations, their spokesman flatly stating that the heroes are now the slaves of&nbsp;their noble mistress, the&nbsp;mighty Khatun Zafara Al'Yil Jin Zarain, Queen of the Mantled Depths, Pontiff of the Diamond Cathedral, Protector&nbsp;of the Malachite Scepter, and so on and so forth. The heroes have other ideas.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As one dao falls supine, wracked with <em>hideous laughter</em> cast by Zap from hiding, Yzak&nbsp;brings the fight in close, laying about with Dawnbringer. The other two dao are able to knock him prone with pummeling blows from their mauls, and then pound him mercilessly as he, normally no easy target, lies prostrate on the ground. With Jagh,&nbsp;Zimmerl, and a shield guardian coming up from the rear, one of the dao decides to take the defensive, casting Wall of Stone to create a dome covering the three genies and their elemental minion. Yzak leaps outside this structure as it is being raised, rather than "trap them inside with him." The heroes lambast the dao with a tirade of taunts and insults, but are unable to goad the patient beings&nbsp;into leaving their stone fort – instead, one of the dao within casts <em>move earth</em>, slowly digging a trench leading under the wall of the dome, inviting any brave hero to crawl into the&nbsp;embrace of these proud slavers waiting above.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The heroes decide to make their own fate, Zimmerl&nbsp;blasting at a section of the stone wall, soon breaching it. Storming inside, the heroes face two upright dao – one still laughing madly. While Yzak, Vesper, and Zap battle fiercely inside the dome, one of the genies glides down into the ground, fleeing Earth-Jagh&nbsp;as he pursues. This chase, though swift, is oddly serene, as both beings merge with the earth itself as they pass through, leaving no trace of their passage. The fleeing genie arises near Zimmerl, hoping to pound the drow with his maul, but falling back on <em>phantasmal killer</em> since Zimmerl is airborne – an ineffectual stratagem against a mystic.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With one dao uncharacteristically incapacitated by Zap's enchantment, the other lone genie fighting beneath the dome falls to force of arms, collapsing into a crystalline powder as its weapons and valuables fall to the packed soil – and dispelling <em>wall of stone</em>. Zimmerl and Jagh&nbsp;make sure to knock out the one who had gone to the fringe of the fighting. As the third finally rises from his insane laughter, Zimmerl&nbsp;mentally dominates him, forcing the dao to cast "his strongest beneficial spell" – <em>invisibility</em> – upon Zimmerl. With one dead, one unconscious, and one dominated, the party has won their skirmish with the evil aspect of elemental earth. Will they attempt to leverage their prisoners for magic and riches of the Inner Planes, or dismiss them as a distraction from the war effort against the demon lords?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</h2><div class="post-content" itemprop="text">

<br>
Day 170 – Flamerule 7&nbsp;(cont.)<br>
<span class="caps">EARTHEN</span> <span class="caps">EMISSARIES</span><br>
With two dao in their clutches, Yzak leads the heroes in pondering the earth genies' fates. Entertaining notions of ransoming the dao to their noble mistress,&nbsp;Khatun Zafara Al'Yil Jin Zarain, the kobold asks Zap to put his flowery words to full effect in a persuasive letter penned in molten gold and sprinkled with gem dust. The heroes, pooling their knowledge, ascertain that the elemental vortex through which the dao traveled appeared north of their present location when a tremor struck a few days ago, and that to reach it would involve traveling through hard bedrock – only easily feasible for Jagh. After traveling to the vortex, they would almost certainly appear buried alive on the near-airless Plane of Earth. Taking on a xorn as a planar guide would magically grant them the ability to breathe earth (and to glide through it), but such a journey would cost some 30,000 gold pieces, and all told would take at least a tenday. Rather than go off on this&nbsp;extraplanar&nbsp;sidequest for the possibility of ransom (or a granted <em>wish</em>), the heroes simply execute the slaving genies&nbsp;and relieve them of their gem-encrusted gear.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RETURN</span> OF <span class="caps">WANDERING</span> <span class="caps">SHADE</span><br>
As the party judges the dao, there is a sudden concentration of darkness, deep even in the eternal gloom of these lightless lands: the heroes are taken aback when Wandering Shade, the tabaxi&nbsp;shadowdancer, appears before them. Shade, who had escaped drow imprisonment in Velkynvelve with them, had seemingly "merged with the shadow" over four months prior, soon after the group had first arrived in Blingdenstone. Though the monk is at first reticent, he eventually reveals that he had been recalled by his order's goddess, Shar, to her divine realm. Thus, Shade has been dwelling at her Towers of Night on the Plane of Shadow, aiding the Lady of Loss's cause by eliminating enemies, and even memories given form by her petitioners, thereby granting her supplicants the forgetfulness that they seek. Thus has Shade added the roguish training of the assassin to his repertoire.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 175 – Flamerule&nbsp;12<br>
<span class="caps">GALLOPING</span> <span class="caps">ARMANITES</span><br>
With Jagh, his borrowed shield guardian, and Zimmerl&nbsp;hanging back, the scouting team goes forward, newly bolstered by Shade's return. While traversing a fairly narrow passage, the scouts hear four sets of hooves trampling through the deep earth. Shade hides behind a handy stalagmite, while Zap and Yzak&nbsp;simply take hold of Vesper as the giant bat dangles from the cavern ceiling. Sure enough, soon a small herd of armanites – the heavy cavalry of the Abyss – round the bend at a spirited pace.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/905388/Armanite.jpg?1538376847"><br>
<br>
<br>
Armanites are living arsenals, with iron-hard hooves and claws supplemented by serrated tails – and like all demons, they are embodiments of rage. Rather than let this fearsome group gallop past, the scouting heroes fall upon them as they pass beneath, with the elven spellcasters moving up to join the fray. Catching the armanites&nbsp;completely off guard, the heroes swiftly dispatch the demons with extreme prejudice. The first one to fall has unique death throes: as it spirals forward, momentum carrying it as death steals its footing, the demon splits into a thousand tiny copies of itself, inch-tall identical armanites&nbsp;all battling one another to the death in a furious instant before being extinguished in a puff of greasy smoke.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">SOCIETY</span> OF <span class="caps">BRILLIANCE</span>: A <span class="caps">GRIM</span> <span class="caps">VISION</span>, <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">SLOOPIDOOP</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the final demon falls, the telltale flash of <em>faerzress&nbsp;</em>lights the passage, and each of the heroes shares the same vision: the Society of Brilliance, arrayed in battle against the Prince of Demons somewhere in the Underdark. Demogorgon wades in against the assembled time-jaunting monstrous geniuses without hesitation. Though physically imposing, the&nbsp;gaze attacks of the Sibilant Beast's twin heads are truly dreadful, beguiling or hypnotizing his foes. Grazillax the mind flayer is stunned by Demogorgon's glare as Y the derro is crushed by a tail slam. Blurg&nbsp;the orog is hypnotized as battle rages around him, and Sloopidoop&nbsp;the kuo-toa&nbsp;archpriest turns and murders his friend. Skriss the troglodyte attacks Sloopidoop; as they scuffle they are both smashed against the cavern wall by Demogorgon's tentacles. Grazillax&nbsp;finally snaps out of his stupor, in time to teleport away from the carnage before Demogorgon can destroy him.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As this vision fades from their senses, the shaken party hears wet, flopping footsteps rounding the bend ahead as none other than&nbsp;Sloopidoop&nbsp;appears before them. Zimmerl&nbsp;puts an image of what they just saw into the kuo-toa's mind, telling him "not to do this" as a precaution. Obviously this unsettles the kuo-toa, but Sloopidoop nonetheless joins with the party, glad that they are bound for Gravenhollow, where he says he first met them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Chapter Eleven: The Stone Library<br>
<br>
Day 179 – Flamerule&nbsp;16<br>
<span class="caps">VELDYSKAR</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TALKING</span> <span class="caps">BASILISK</span><br>
As the heroic scouts follow the lead of&nbsp;Ghazrim DuLoc's star ruby ring, they hear echoing sounds of song coming from a grotto up ahead. The lyrics vary from Common to Undercommon, Dwarvish to Giant, and Yzak&nbsp;(as a Harper and a student of his humanoid prey) recognizes the melodies mostly as&nbsp;traditional Underdark&nbsp;folk songs. Oddly, Yzak also can tell that the singer is no humanoid. The scouts ready their weapons. As they creep forward to an intersection, they are surprised to see an eight-legged reptile – a basilisk – stretching out (as though it has been waiting a long while) and rising to meet them, averting its eyes (and thus its petrifying gaze) as it speaks in various languages until it determines all of the heroes can understand Undercommon. The basilisk introduces himself as Veldyskar, explaining that untold years ago he was gifted by a visiting&nbsp;stone giant druid to the librarians at Gravenhollow, and now serves them as a guardian and general-purpose helper. His latest task is to guide the heroes to the stone library, which has been expecting their arrival.&nbsp;Checking that the basilisk's route matches with DuLoc's&nbsp;magical ring, the heroes follow this helpful monster.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 180 – Flamerule&nbsp;17<br>
<span class="caps">REACHING</span> <span class="caps">GRAVENHOLLOW</span>&nbsp;<br>
Eventually Veldyskar&nbsp;brings the group to a pair of massive basalt doors flanked by a pair of life-sized statues of stone giants. Sloopidoop, who has been here before, walks up and pushes on the giant doors, which yield to his will. The statues reveal their true nature as golems as their heads turn, silently watching the party as they enter this bastion of peace and order, long ago carved out of the bones of the world. Zap asks Veldyskar&nbsp;who else is currently inside, but the basilisk replies that the concept of "is" is somewhat muddied in this place.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906403/GravenhollowDoor.PNG?1538706094"><br>
<br>
Walking across the threshold of Gravenhollow is like stepping into another realm. The oppressive gloom of the Underdark is replaced by light and a sense of openness akin to the surface world, with a high, vaulting ceiling above a fifty-foot wide corridor. Veldyskar&nbsp;guides the heroes through the gates, instructing them to go straight ahead before disappearing down a side passage. The corridor opens into a huge&nbsp;central well, with walkways crossing its span to the opposite side. The heroes can barely see the ends of the level to their left and right, with doors opening into so many rooms that they could not explore them all in a single day. The ceiling is bright, with rainbows trapped in hundreds of crystal formations combining to create a warm and inviting illumination. Looking down is a dizzying experience – staircases connect to many different levels below, and the party quickly loses count of how far down the landings go.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As the party marvels at the spectacle, a stout, rocky creature – a galeb duhr – detaches itself from the perfectly smooth wall, leaving an imprint of its body that quickly fades out of sight. The elemental introduces itself as Hourm, and explains that the resources of Gravenhollow are theirs, including guest quarters – they need only ask.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">NAVIGATING</span> <span class="caps">GRAVENHOLLOW</span>&nbsp;- <span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">SOCIETY</span> OF <span class="caps">BRILLIANCE</span>&nbsp;<br>
With no reference point on how to utilize the stone library, the heroes are pleasantly surprised when all five members of the Society of Brilliance appear before them. Sloopidoop&nbsp;recognizes that these are "echoes" of the Society's visit here years ago, on a pilgrimage of enlightenment during which they encountered the echoes of the heroes, for Gravenhollow "remembers" all those who have walked its halls, as will as all those who ever shall. These&nbsp;apparitions constantly flicker in and out of existence in the library, quasi-real duplicates of the time-displaced knowledge-seekers they represent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906410/SocBril.PNG?1538707785"><br>
<br>
The Society members' echoes&nbsp;explain to the party all the ins and outs of the seemingly simple cavernous halls that are Gravenhollow. The library is carved from a titanic geode whose crystals are imbued with magic that concentrates <em>faerzress</em>, profoundly affecting time and space and altering the perceptions and reality of all beings within its walls. The library is apparently bigger on the inside than out, and the notion of space works strangely here – the interior continually expands as lore is added, but visitors can still traverse all its floors and chambers with ease. Only the most absentminded and scatterbrained become lost here, explains the gruff orog&nbsp;Blurg. Furthermore, each room on each level of Gravenhollow&nbsp;is part of either the Archives of the Past, the Archives of the Present, or the Archives of the Future. Galeb duhr&nbsp;assistants pick up tablets as the librarians – one stone giant assigned to each collection – carve and catalog them. The classification system used by the giants to organize the library's information, however, is known only to the librarians.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906411/GravenhollowLibrarians.PNG?1538707815"><br>
<br>
The library is a window into time and history, and the magic permeating it cuts the library off from the real world around it – it is hidden from magic, and no divination cast outside the library can discern anything within it.&nbsp;All creatures within the library enjoy the benefits of a <em>comprehend languages</em> spell. Finally, Gravenhollow is a place of peace, and visitors are expected to conduct themselves with decorum, refraining from arguments and violence. Creatures that incite conflict will quickly draw the attention of Veldyskar or any number of galeb duhr. Glad that the heroes have arrived for their appointed all-important purpose, and having instructed them in the library's use, the Society fades from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Jagh, having the strongest willpower of anyone in the party, leads the group to find information on the summoner who began the current crisis. The druid's intuition leads him to a nearby room attuned to history. All rooms devoted to the Archives of the Past has the same inscription carved above its doorway in runes proclaiming "The past is a crystal, for it can be seen from many facets, yet it always remains the same." Fitting neatly into niches carved into the walls are stone and crystal slabs, monoliths, and stelae, all carved with runes and glyphs recording the librarians' understanding of events as told by their visions and networks of messengers and informants. Among these records stands&nbsp;Ulthar, the Keeper of the Past, sorting,&nbsp;filing, and cross-referencing&nbsp;ancient texts in his immeasurably vast catalog as he ponders the next stanza of his latest work of epic poetry. Ulthar&nbsp;doesn't take note of the heroes until they demand his attention, at which point the giant greets them as figments out of dreams. Ulthar makes it obvious he believes these dreams have wisdom to share, and is infinitely patient with them, willing to spend time with the little folk and discuss history with them. Zap asks about the library itself, curious who built it, but even the&nbsp;current librarians do not know that – all they know is that the place has existed since the dawn of giantkind&nbsp;- over 30,000 years ago at the beginning of the Dawn Age, before the coming of elves and dwarves,&nbsp;when the giants' chief god Annam the All-Father and his sons founded six kindred kingdoms.&nbsp;Regarding the place's use, however, the keeper explains that, while in Gravenhollow,&nbsp;one attuned to a <em>stonespeaker&nbsp;crystal</em> – such as Zap, who bears the one given them by Stonespeaker&nbsp;Hgraam of Gracklstugh – can peer through the veils of time and receive visions of the past, present, and future. First, Zap chooses to&nbsp;glimpse the conjuring that began this great crisis.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PAST</span>: <span class="caps">GROMPH</span>'S <span class="caps">FOLLY</span>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
An imperious dark elf archwizard&nbsp;in spider-silk robes covered in runes of power casts a mighty conjuration spell. As the ritual draws toward its conclusion, a web of <em>faerzress</em>&nbsp;energy expands outward. The wizard seems alarmed by this, his efforts to complete the spell growing more crazed as he realizes he's lost control. And then, madness! Rifts open in the web of energy around him. These cracks stretch and widen, and through them come horrific fiends that scream, shriek, and howl as they are wrenched from the Abyss and cast into the Underdark. A woman's deep, dark laugh echoes in the heroes' minds as the drow wizard shrinks away from the demonic hordes he has unwittingly unleashed. Zimmerl recognizes his house sigil as that of House Baenre, the longtime first ruling house of Menzoberranzan, and thus the mage as Gromph Baenre, the Master of Sorcere&nbsp;and Archmage of Menzoberranzan, as well as brother to Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">BRUENOR</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">BATTLEHAMMER</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the party heads for the Archives of the Present, on a staircase landing&nbsp;they run across an echo of Bruenor from far in the future. The dwarf king's red hair and beard have turned mostly white, and he leans heavily on a thick crystal cane. He is old, frail, and quite senile, and he can't remember why he came to Gravenhollow or what he's looking for. The echo fades as the aged hero&nbsp;calls out helplessly for Drizzt or Catti-brie.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">BAPHOMET</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MAZE</span> <span class="caps">ENGINE</span><br>
On their first visit to a hall dedicated to current affairs, the heroes pass beneath a doorway thusly emblazoned: "the present is like sand, ever flowing and escaping one's grasp without mercy or respite."&nbsp;Urmas, the Keeper of the Present, is holding court with a varied collection of subterranean fauna, sending them out to scour the Realms Below for any hints of the demon lords' activity, or receiving the same dire news from those returning. Urmas&nbsp;is very busy, and&nbsp;he suffers the heroes' questions and presence only out of duty and politeness until they reveal that they have personally encountered Demogorgon, Zuggtmoy, and Graz'zt, and have even cast Fraz-Urb'luu&nbsp;back to the Abyss. Thus the heroes gain Urmas's immediate and full attention.<br>
<br>
Zap choosing to experience a vision of the now, the heroes are treated to a first-person vision. The smell of blood fills their nostrils as they wander a maze of Underdark tunnels, moving with purpose as their giant hooves crush stones underfoot. <em>Faerzress</em>&nbsp;light reveals that their shadows are monstrous, suggesting a hulking beast with a crown of horns. With their bloody glaives, they carve a swath through a forest of towering zurkhwood mushrooms that stand in their way. The tunnels beyond would confuse an ordinary mind, but they instinctively know the path they must walk. Every step brings them closer to a magma-filled chasm, lodged in which is an enormous contraption of metal and stone – a weapon capable of reshaping the Underdark itself. The heroes, schooled in planar lore, recognize this demon lord as Baphomet&nbsp;the Horned King, and that he is likely in the Labyrinth, an area of the Underdark known to contain many minotaurs where the Prince of Beasts' cult is old and large.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/909977/Baphomet.jpg?1539537697"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">ZUGGTMOY</span>&nbsp;<br>
In thanks for their tales of encountering the demon lords, Urmas&nbsp;bestows a vision of the Lady of Rot and Decay. Eras of time being defined here by giant standards, the present essentially begins after Gromph's&nbsp;botched summoning. Thus, they see the cavern of peculiar beauty that was Neverlight Grove opening up before them, lights of every color shining from the pure essence of life, diffused and amplified by the glow of <em>faerzress</em>. The glow pulses, and they can feel the life in the cavern rotting away, bursting with infection. A mushroom grows in the center of the cave, ever larger and taller, pustules forming and seeping as its stem thickens and its cap reaches to the cavern's ceiling, forming the vast fungal tower of Yggmorgus. Two myconids approach the site in awe, not minding the carpet of rot beneath their feet. The heroes sense the myconids' minds coming alive in wonder, and as they kneel in worship, they know that they are doomed. A voice sounds out within clouds of spores that fall like snow, telling the myconids&nbsp;to prepare for a gift unlike any they have ever known. The heroes&nbsp;recognize one&nbsp;myconid as Sovereign Phylo, while somehow knowing that the other is Yestabrod before it became mutated.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">JALYNFEIN</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">OBLODRA</span>&nbsp;<br>
A quick look at tomes of demonology and metaphysics hint to Yzak that slaying the demon lords here on the Material Plane will send them back to the Abyss, just as with any other summoned creature. While researching, the echo of a young male&nbsp;drow&nbsp;flickers to life in the archive. As he wears a veil (to cover his blind eyes)&nbsp;and the sigil of none other than Zimmerl's own all-but-extinct House Oblodra, Zimmerl&nbsp;deduces that this is Jalynfein&nbsp;the Spider Mage, who was blinded and cast out, but survived. Jalynfein must have found his way here, hoping to overcome his blindness and take revenge on his family via arcane training. Jalynfein&nbsp;thus views Zimmerl&nbsp;as a potential foe, but his gusto is stolen by Zimmerl when the mystic proclaims that, in the present, House Oblodra was destroyed by House Baenre&nbsp;over a century ago, during the Time of Troubles. Crestfallen that he did not arrange the fall, Jalynfein's echo fades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">FUTURE</span>: <span class="caps">GRACKLSTUGH</span>&nbsp;<br>
Seeking out a room of prophecy, the heroes see runes above the doorway reading "The future is a song we remember, but we cannot rush to its end lest we destroy the melody." Unlike the quiet halls of past and present, this room echoes with sounds of running water, with the wall niches containing the stone cylinders that Ustova favors for scribing also acting as fountains, where water shimmers over crystal as it falls. Ustova, the Keeper of the Future, is a seer who is deep in meditation when the heroes enter, transcribing her visions as she experiences them, sorting through the various threads of destiny and possibility for omens presaging the resurgence of the giants' once-great civilization. Now, however, her senses are overwhelmed by the fiendish threat of the tanar'ri.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Requesting a vision of the future in the City of Blades, the heroes see a circle of small hooded figures, their forms hunched and emaciated. Their gestures and movements are jerky, indicative of the madness possessing them. They are chanting, swaying to their own words. And then they stop as the glow of <em>faerzress</em>&nbsp;rises around them, whispering to them in unintelligible sounds. The derro&nbsp;cackle and dance, their hands glowing with a power that isn't theirs. The vision shifts, and suddenly gray dwarves stare down at the red-hot metal on their anvils. The constant rhythm of their hammering falters. Suddenly, brother turns against brother as minds turn inward upon themselves. Sparks fly and a city burns.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">ELMINSTER</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">ALUSTRIEL</span>&nbsp;<br>
Heading back toward the library's central well, the heroes bump into a pair of echoes – one a crotchety old wizard with a red pointy hat, the other a tall silver-haired woman of regal bearing, likewise bearing magician's talismans.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906433/Elminster.PNG?1538714457"><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906434/Alustriel_Silverhand.jpg?1538714476"><br>
<br>
The venerable red-robed wizard is smoking a pipe fuming with vile bluish-green&nbsp;smoke and is muttering to himself, claiming he and his ally Alustriel are searching for some long-forgotten spell, saying he has forgotten more magic than most will ever know.&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems almost startled by the heroes' approach, and introduces himself as Elminster Aumar, a.k.a. the Old Mage, the Sage of Shadowdale, et cetera. He notices Zap's Harper pin, and the 1200-year old spellcaster remarks that, had he known how bad a harpist he would turn out to be, he would have named the organization something different. Elminster&nbsp;then seems to recognize the party as being integral to&nbsp;the great catastrophe of the Year of the Rage of Demons, 1487 DR.&nbsp;The heroes, seeking his wisdom, ask how the event was resolved. Not wanting to divulge too much of the future, the puissant&nbsp;wizard&nbsp;says only that many great heroes were lost to the demonic tide, but several powerful demon lords were driven back to the Abyss. Lady Alustriel, a legendary leader and wizard in her own right, and likewise a Chosen of Mystra, beholds the heroes with kind eyes and a certain whimsy, gently admonishing them for trying to learn too much of what is yet to come. Before the heroes can press the legendary arcanists for any more details, Elminster&nbsp;declares that he is off to relax at somewhere called "Yellowstone National Park in the year 1894" on a world called Earth (a parallel to Oerth, along with&nbsp;Aerth, Uerth, and Yarth, which differ in geography but primarily in the relative presence of magic). The two Chosens' echoes thus fade, each bidding the heroes good luck.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ENEMY</span> OF MY <span class="caps">ENEMY</span>&nbsp;<br>
As&nbsp;Jagh leads the group across the warped space of Gravenhollow, they are crossing one of the impossibly deep central well's crisscrossing walkways when they run into a duo – not echoes, but physically present. One is a withered male&nbsp;drow&nbsp;in dark flowing robes, whose pinched and lined face speaks to his great age, even by elven&nbsp;standards. The other a hulking gray-skinned monster resembling a spiky humanoid toad, its wide mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. The knowledgeable heroes recognize this as a slaad. Slaadi are native to the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, embodiments of entropy, but death slaadi&nbsp;have been corrupted by evil via the Negative Energy Plane, and are sadistically cruel.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906559/Vizeran_DeVir.PNG?1538774283"><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/906561/Death_Slaad.PNG?1538774311"><br>
<br>
The death slaad&nbsp;moves defensively in front of its apparent master, whose red eyes narrow as he appraises the heroes. The drow&nbsp;cautiously greets the adventurers, introducing himself as the archmage&nbsp;Vizeran DeVir, and asking what business brings them to Gravenhollow. Yzak&nbsp;lies at first, claiming they are echoes of heroes investigating the Spellplague&nbsp;a century prior. This flimsy claim is easily disproved, given the party's substantial forms.&nbsp;Though somewhat cool in demeanor, Vizeran&nbsp;remains polite and makes no pretense toward violence in this place of peace.<br>
<br>
Zimmerl recognizes the amulet around Vizeran's&nbsp;neck as an unholy symbol of the Elder Elemental Eye, the&nbsp;force behind the&nbsp;various cults of Elemental Evil;&nbsp;Vizeran&nbsp;does not deny his nature but simply insists that he is by far the most inconsequential of the many evils that the heroes must contend with, and that he has opposed the tyranny of Lolth and her priestesses for centuries. Zimmerl, perhaps because openly speaking of extinguished houses is forbidden within Menzoberranzan, does not recognize the name DeVir, but Zap has heard of this house, destroyed by House Do'Urden on the day of Drizzt Do'Urden's birth almost 200 years ago. Both Vizeran and Zimmerl are thus survivors of fallen houses, now living outside the matriarchy of Lolth's priestesses and rising in personal power apart from drow society.&nbsp;Vizeran&nbsp;civilly chooses not to press the issue of the heroes not being echoes, saying that he has come here to confirm that there is a demonic invasion into the larger Underdark, and to make plans to combat it. Vizeran&nbsp;suggests that the heroes make their own inquiries about Menzoberranzan and its archmage&nbsp;Gromph, and that they meet at his quarters the next day to compare notes over luncheon.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PAST</span>: <span class="caps">CYROG</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">LIVES</span>! <span class="caps">HAIL</span> <span class="caps">ORCUS</span>!&nbsp;<br>
As Vizeran&nbsp;and his death slaad&nbsp;companion go their own way, Zap and Yzak elect&nbsp;to follow them for a time. The drow&nbsp;soon comes to a room filled with the works of Ulthar, Keeper of the Past. Indeed, it is Ulthar's own quarters "near the bottom"&nbsp;of the seemingly-bottomless library. The walls here are covered in murals and carvings, and workshops where the giant engages in crafting.&nbsp;Vizeran&nbsp;raises his <em>stonespeaker crystal</em>, asking the library for a vision of Orcus the Blood Lord.&nbsp;<br>
In the heart of an alien cavern glistening with slime, scores of mind flayers gather around an enormous brain resting in a pool. The brain is dead. Zap can hear the illithids' incomprehensible thoughts as they mourn its passing. One word echoes louder than the others: Cyrog. Suddenly, <em>faerzress</em>&nbsp;bathes the dark and twisted hall in purplish light. A rift opens, and a hulking, horned figure that reeks of putrescence steps out. It raises a skull-tipped wand and points it at the dead elder brain. The brain begins to pulsate, and Zap sees intermittent flashes of purple light under its rotting flesh. The mind flayers are aghast as the elder brain speaks to them once more, telling them that Orcus has saved Cyrog, and commanding them to follow it into undeath.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/907262/Orcus_Cyrog.jpg?1538968998"><br>
<br>
The vision ends, and the stealthy heroes slip&nbsp;back to the others before Vizeran's&nbsp;vigilant bodyguard can notice him. Before leaving, Yzak&nbsp;boldly approaches a shelf in Ulthar's quarters, where the trusting librarian keeps another&nbsp;<em>stonespeaker crystal</em> lying about, stealing it to expedite the heroes' research.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">HGRAAM</span>&nbsp;<br>
Venturing across the library's stairways and walkways, an echo flickers to life before the heroes: a much younger version of Stonespeaker&nbsp;Hgraam, chieftain and shaman of the Cairngorm Clan of stone giants native to Gracklstugh. Hgraam&nbsp;treats the adventurers as spirits and asks them philosophical questions about the nature of dreams, bidding them farewell with a promise to remember them, as he did when the heroes met him in Cairngorm Caverns in their first visit to the City of Blades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">LOOSE</span> <span class="caps">ENDS</span>&nbsp;<br>
After seeing the same vision they once already received via <em>faerzress</em>&nbsp;of the Pudding King receiving the "blessing" of endless hunger and his two royal oozes from Juiblex the Faceless Lord, the heroes also confirm via mundane research that Shar, the Mistress of the Night, is alive (asserted by Shade but disputed by Yzak). Furthermore, with a vision of the future, the party sees a&nbsp;Faerûn&nbsp;conquered by demons: with the Underdark&nbsp;under the Abyssal princes' thumbs, monsters of the Lower Planes flood out of the Realms Below to raid mortal settlements for food, slaves, or base amusement. Eventually, the baatezu&nbsp;would come in force as well to compete with the tanar'ri&nbsp;for mortal souls, making Toril just one more theater in the eternal Blood War between demon and devil.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yzak, curious for any other examples of demon lords being defeated in&nbsp;Faerûnian history, finds examples of Gorian's&nbsp;Ward (a hero about whom little is known, active a century ago in Baldur's Gate and Amn) and his companions (including the mad ranger Minsc) defeating Demogorgon at a Helmite fortress called Watcher's Keep,&nbsp;freeing the Prince of Demons&nbsp;rather than risk imprisonment themselves. There is also the tale of Gareth Dragonsbane, the paladin-king of Damara, who with his companions stole and destroyed the Wand of Orcus – and yet Draco Paladin, Bahamut&nbsp;the Justicemaker, told Gareth that this destruction would last only a single century, a time which has already elapsed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Finally, with a present vision of Gromph&nbsp;Baenre, the heroes witness the fugitive wizard, furtively moving beneath the starry sky of the surface world amidst dockside alleyways. Though the more surface-savvy of the heroes do recognize some of the flags flittering in the nighttime breeze, it is the height of the summer trade season, and merchant ships from all along the Sword Coast – from&nbsp;Luskan to Calimport – are represented – it is impossible for them to tell at a glance which harbor they gaze upon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before turning in for bed, Yzak&nbsp;decides to return the "borrowed" <em>stonespeaker crystal</em>, lest the library's keepers discover the theft and deny their guests access to the&nbsp;archives.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DARK</span> <span class="caps">PRINCE</span> <span class="caps">GRAZ</span>'ZT&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/907267/Graz_zt_conquest.jpg?1538970405"><br>
<br>
Having put their <em>stonespeaker crystals</em> to their full use for the day, the mentally exhausted heroes head up toward their lodgings, empty upon their arrival but now fully furnished according to their individual tastes and needs. Just as they arrive at the top level of the library, a vivid echo appears before them of the Dark Prince of Pleasure, Graz'zt himself. The demon lord is gathering all the information he can about the Underdark, and says that he just saw the adventurers&nbsp;a few weeks prior at the Silken Knot (which occurred some four months ago), where he had let on that he was interested in why he had been called to the Material Plane, unlike his more bestial peers.<br>
<br>
Graz'zt also says that he has been researching the heroes themselves as well, and admits he is impressed by their work. The demon lord then launches into a towering monologue:<br>
"Are you really so different from we&nbsp;demons? All but the druid among you sing the beautiful song of chaos, and none of you are truly moral. Are these the heroes this world&nbsp;has&nbsp;to offer? You have little and less in common with your 'allies'&nbsp;Bruenor Battlehammer, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, or even the Zhentarim. What will&nbsp;you do if you do succeed in your quest – retire to while away your days counting taxes for a king, and going to fight and die at his command? No – you are killers,&nbsp;liars, thieves, and betrayers of the highest order! For Yzak and Zimmerl, power is your first concern. Why not join the winning side? They've offered you, what? A&nbsp;scrap of dirt and a parchment with a title on it? Perhaps some trifling material goods? Why not taste real power, and join my court at the Argent Palace? With my&nbsp;armies at your back, you could conquer an entire layer of the Abyss for yourselves. The infinite layers of chaos provide more excitement and opportunity for growth&nbsp;than the entirety of mortal existence. You seem to be knowledgeable and capable mortals, perhaps you could offer me the knowledge I need to return home, and you may&nbsp;rule at my side. I happen to be planning to absorb an entire world of this mortal plane into the Abyss and turn it into my fourth kingdom – perhaps you could serve as&nbsp;my viceroys there. My son Iuz could certainly use a guiding hand on Oerth. And when you do inevitably die, I could see to it that you are reborn not as some pathetic petitioner,&nbsp;but as balors – fearsome and ferocious from the day of your creation!&nbsp;But for now…how can I aid you this day? Let us bargain."<br>
<br>
Zap seems interested in the offer of being reborn as a balor&nbsp;in death, but worries that there is little way to hold the Dark Prince accountable for his offer, and fears Graz'zt&nbsp;simply wishes for mortal pawns against the other demon lords while gaining souls in the same stroke. Zimmerl&nbsp;thanks Graz'zt for the Amulet of Vanity which has served the mystic so well in his telepathic charms, and in exchange (and over Zap's protests) the drow&nbsp;offers that the party has discovered that&nbsp;the responsible summoner, Gromph, is lying low in a port somewhere along the Sword Coast. Graz'zt finds this very interesting.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Though a distinct bargain is not struck, the heroes converse fairly amiably with the archfiend. They&nbsp;ask why Graz'zt&nbsp;doesn't allow them to defeat him to send him back to the Abyss (or simply suicide), to which Graz'zt&nbsp;says that "he doesn't have it in him." Graz'zt also bemoans the fact that he is a lover and a talker, not an explorer, and that perhaps if he were better friends with Baphomet or Yeenoghu&nbsp;they might guide him out of the Underdark – if they're not too busy ripping each other's throats out. The Dark Prince's echo flickers away with a promise to be in touch.</p>

Day 181 – Flamerule&nbsp;18<br>
As a new day&nbsp;dawns upon the surface world above, the awakening heroes find that the&nbsp;tabaxi&nbsp;ninja Wandering Shade has merged&nbsp;with the shadow once more. Who knows when he might return?<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">THEMBERCHAUD</span>&nbsp;<br>
The heroes disperse from their personalized living quarters, with&nbsp;Jagh&nbsp;leading the way to a nearby archive of the present. Zap requests a vision of the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh – Gravenhollow, in its wisdom, presents the heroes perhaps not with what they ask, but what the library deems they should know. Consequently, the heroes see the derro&nbsp;triarchy of the Gray Ghosts thieves' guild. The twin sisters&nbsp;Aliinka and Zubriska, recently-converted&nbsp;Demogorgon worshippers, whisper in the ear of Uskvil, and unanimously the Ghosts decide to ally with the cultists in the Whorlstone Tunnels. Weeks later, Aliinka is slain in those tunnels by the heroes. Months after that, Zubriska and Uskvil, now in the favor of the ruling Themberchaud, whisper in the dragon's ear, and at night they make sacrifices to the wicked creatures lurking in the Darklake. Several foreigners have gone missing lately in the Darklake District…<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">ANDARIN</span> <span class="caps">ZARITH</span><br>
The echo of a Red Wizard of Thay&nbsp;appears, treating the heroes as annoying apparitions and refusing to deal with them. This changes when Zimmerl&nbsp;successfully bluffs that he is an agent of Szass Tam, demanding to know how Zarith's&nbsp;research is progressing. Zarith&nbsp;proudly declares that he and his fellows have captured six Chosen of various deities, and are prepared to proceed with experimentation!&nbsp;Though the Red Wizard does not disclose what time period he is from, the heroes do not recognize his scheme as a historical event. Zimmerl, intrigued, asks when transportation shall begin, and Zarith&nbsp;responds that the six will be moved upon the morrow. Then he fades away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/909979/Aznar_Thrul_-_Todd_Lockwood.jpg?1539537938"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">FRAZ</span>-<span class="caps">URB</span>'<span class="caps">LUU</span>, <span class="caps">PRINCE</span> OF <span class="caps">DECEPTION</span>&nbsp;<br>
In Urmas's&nbsp;own quarters, which contain the only actual books and scrolls in the entire library, Zap activates his <em>stonespeaker&nbsp;crystal</em> to see the current doings of the demon lord of illusion. Thus, he sees the entire history of Fraz-Urb'luu's gem from when it was wrenched from the Abyss containing the demon lord's soul, to when it was shattered by the heroes at Mantol-Derith.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Just as within a dream, the onlooking heroes have an intrinsic understanding of things they could not possibly know.&nbsp; In a nondescript subterranean tunnel, they&nbsp;see a simple, lone quaggoth pick up a huge black gemstone, instantly adopting a regal bearing. Derendil&nbsp;later drops the stone as he is enslaved by drow&nbsp;wearing the emblem of House Mizzrym (including Sarith Kzekarit!), it clattering to the floor before being picked up months later by a passing duergar&nbsp;- Krimgol Muzgardt.&nbsp;Krimgol is deluded by the gem into thinking he is a <em>calassabrak </em>- a duergar without honor -&nbsp;and in Mantol-Derith he paid Yantha Coaxrock, an honest svirfneblin mage,&nbsp;to appraise the jewel, thinking to use it to buy back the goodwill of his clan. Touched by the gem's madness, Yantha lied to Krimgol and told him the gem was&nbsp;worthless. When she offered a lump of gold in exchange, Krimgol suspected treachery and demanded the gem's immediate return. While they argued, Yantha's apprentice&nbsp;Flink Thunderbonk tried to hide the gem for his mistress, but succumbed to its evil power. Flink went to the drow enclave, hoping to trade the gem for some rare&nbsp;spell components he imagined Yantha needed to make Krimgol go away. A gargoyle assigned to watch for thieves spotted the gem and wrested it from Flink, who hid in&nbsp;paranoid fear of his mistress's wrath. Then, the delusional gargoyle laid eyes on a drow assassin named Kinyel Druu'giir and was instantly smitten by her. The&nbsp;gargoyle gave her the gem as a sign of devotion, which she, in her madness, mistook as a payment to assassinate Lorthuun, the maimed beholder allied with the&nbsp;Zhentarim. Yantha's theft of the gem led Krimgol to leave and return with reinforcements, attacking the svirfneblin enclave and capturing Yantha. With the peace&nbsp;broken, the Zhentarim and drow enclave leaders (Ghazrim DuLoc and Sirak Mazelor, respectively)&nbsp;planned to meet to negotiate splitting the outpost between them, but the assassin Kinyel went along with the drow&nbsp;delegation in order to eliminate Lorthuun at the meeting. Then, of course, the heroes arrived after having rescued&nbsp;Yantha&nbsp;from Krimgol and the duergar, and finding Flink&nbsp;cowering in the drow&nbsp;fungal garden. The heroes approach the drow delegation, thinking that Sirak&nbsp;meant to turn on their contact DuLoc, and the drow&nbsp;attack when the heroes will not leave the pavilion. Kinyel, dueling with Zap, turned her attention to Lorthuun when the beholder revealed itself. The entire drow&nbsp;delegation was slaughtered in the skirmish, including the deluded gargoyle which leapt to the confused Kinyel's defense. Soon after obtaining the gem, despite Zap and Yzak&nbsp;falling prey to madness of their own, the party destroys the gem and sends Fraz-Urb'luu&nbsp;back to Hollow's Heart, his layer of the Abyss.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">YEENOGHU</span>, <span class="caps">BEAST</span> OF <span class="caps">BUTCHERY</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the vision ends, the heroes note that Vizeran&nbsp;DeVir&nbsp;and his slaadi&nbsp;bodyguard have entered the room, and vainly note that "some of us have banished demon lords, and some of us have not." Ignoring the slight (or perhaps filing it away for later), Vizeran&nbsp;shares a vision of his own choosing, electing to scry upon the Gnoll Lord. A hunched and rotting creature with the head of a fiendish hyena swings a triple-headed flail at a beholder, crushing it. As the eye tyrant falls to the floor, a pack of hyenas leaps onto the corpse and tears off its eyestalks while the demon lord licks the gore off his weapon. As the hyenas feast, they transform into slavering, cackling gnolls before your eyes. As the vision ends, some of the heroes believe that the relatively rigid passages indicate that he, like his archrival Baphomet, stalks the halls of The Labyrinth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
A <span class="caps">LUNCHEON</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">VIZERAN</span>&nbsp;<br>
DeVir invites the adventurers&nbsp;to follow up on the previous day's offer, saying it is time to compare notes over a midday meal. In his own quarters (decorated in drow-like fashion, yet devoid of Lolthite&nbsp;arachnid imagery), Vizeran&nbsp;has the attendant&nbsp;galeb&nbsp;duhr&nbsp;serve food magically created by the library, to wit:&nbsp;algae ale, mushroom moonshine, toasted salamander in mineral pepper, fried fungus, and&nbsp;arachnidumplings. Vizeran&nbsp;pardons himself for forgetting his pleasantries yesterday, introducing his death slaad&nbsp;bodyguard as Kleve. As the heroes settle in with their choice of Underdark delicacies, Vizeran&nbsp;makes his offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That fool Gromph&nbsp;brought the demon lords down upon us, with his demon queen pulling his strings all the while. He has given Lolth&nbsp;free reign in the Abyss. My own research leads me to believe Gromph&nbsp;used <em>faerzress</em>&nbsp;to achieve such a summoning, though I'm sure he didn't intend this result. Imbecile! This is what happens when diviners meddle in conjuration.&nbsp;<br>
"I can save you months of research – time we clearly don't have. The information I found here has confirmed my theories, and I know how to banish the demon lords back to the Abyss. We can do this only if we work together, if you are willing and daring enough to directly challenge the demon lords. Or perhaps foolhardy is the better word."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Much to Vizeran's&nbsp;surprise, the heroes take this suggestion in stride and accept it nonchalantly – he had expected to have to cajole, plead with, and bribe them. Vizeran says to Zimmerl&nbsp;Oblodra that his house&nbsp;always was recklessly brash!&nbsp;Vizeran then invites the heroes to his home – Araj, the Tower of Vengeance – to discuss the matter further.&nbsp;Zap wants to hear the plan here and now, but Vizeran scoffs, refusing to discuss strategy in a place where "the walls literally have ears, and echoes linger forever." Only Araj, he says,&nbsp;- is secure enough&nbsp;to discuss in detail how to plan the demon lords' defeat. Vizeran insists that his goal is the same as the heroes' own, and he doesn't ask them to involve themselves in any of his other plans. When the heroes accuse him of having ulterior motives, the archmage&nbsp;thinly smiles, and agrees. Though he normally deigns not to make risky <em>teleport</em>s<em>&nbsp;</em>within the <em>faerzress</em>-infused&nbsp;Underdark, Vizeran&nbsp;reluctantly hands out a rune sequence to a teleportation circle near his home, and agrees this astral shortcut is the most prudent means of travel given the urgency of their quest. Vizeran and Kleve then <em>teleport</em> back to Araj to await the heroes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ECHO</span>: <span class="caps">YAULN</span>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/907688/Stone_Giant.PNG?1539075359"></p>
<p><br>
As the heroes leave Vizeran's quarters, a stone giant echo appears before them, clad in the raiment of the ancient past. Yauln&nbsp;came to Gravenhollow&nbsp;to seek answers on whether his clan should enter into alliance with the bearer of the Cairngorm Crown – i.e., the duergar&nbsp;Deepking. This would put Yauln's timeline around -3717 DR, the founding of Gracklstugh, and marks Yauln&nbsp;as a distant precursor to the Cairngorm Clan's current leader, Stonespeaker&nbsp;Hgraam. Yzak&nbsp;interjects, posing as a wise dream spirit, instructing Yauln&nbsp;to enter into the alliance as history knows that he did, but also details the heroic party, instructing Yauln to hoard the clan's wealth in preparation for their arrival. Though Hgraam did not shower them with gifts (other than a <em>stonespeaker crystal</em>!) during their one meeting with the shamanic chieftain, and although the echo is only quasi-real, the heroes look forward to future investments.

<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">LOLTH</span>, <span class="caps">DEMON</span> <span class="caps">QUEEN</span> OF <span class="caps">SPIDERS</span><br>
The heroes glean a glimpse of the drow goddess's Abyssal realm, the Demonweb Pits. They behold the true form of the Spider Queen – a black, bloated arachnid with the head of a female drow. Nestled in the webs all around her are thousands upon thousands of gray eggs. Lolth&nbsp;knows she is being scried, her fury tangible as her mind reaches out to find the heroes' sensor. Her shriek of rage as she's shut out by the powerful wards of Gravenhollow&nbsp;echoes in their minds as the vision is suddenly torn away to darkness, and the threat of madness pulls at them all, with Yzak losing some of his tenuous sanity.&nbsp;Unlike the other demon lords (which, despite her elevation to divinity, she is still counted as by demonologists), this vision confirms that&nbsp;Lolth&nbsp;remains in her otherwordly home.&nbsp;<br>

From the thousand threads of Keeper Ustova's&nbsp;prophecies, the heroes behold the Savage Frontier&nbsp;in the Realms Above. The hardy peoples of the North are no strangers to giant incursions, with frost giants&nbsp;having long claimed the Spine of the World as their demesne, and hill giants being known to scrounge for food in the untamed uplands. But soon, giants of every kind&nbsp;will emerge from their strongholds in force to threaten civilization as never before – not just hill and frost giants, but all the sons of Annam the All-Father.&nbsp;Fire giants press-gang&nbsp;entire villages into the desert, frost giant greatships reave along&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sword Coast, and even cloud giants' floating castles appear&nbsp;in the skies above human cities.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
The heroes look with surprise and no small suspicion at Ustova as the seer's eyes open, her divination tools falling from her hands in&nbsp;shock. The giant says she has been waiting for this day since she gained her oracular powers, and that long have giant mystics&nbsp;wondered what portents might be gained of the upcoming Year of the Storm King's Thunder.&nbsp;Perhaps the time of the little people is coming&nbsp;to an end.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PRESENT</span>: <span class="caps">GRAZ</span>'ZT&nbsp;<br>
Wondering what the Dark Prince of Pleasure is up to at this moment, Zap focuses his <em>stonespeaker crystal</em>. He conjures up&nbsp;a vision of an obviously drow city – and yet one that Zimmerl immediately recognizes as <em>not </em>Menzoberranzan. Shouldering through a delicately curving archway onto the open space of a tower balcony, a female fire giant surveys the&nbsp;city with the proud and domineering gaze of a ruler. From behind her comes the now-familiar figure of Graz'zt. At that moment, the observing heroes note the six fingers on each of the giantess's hands, and the familial gaze given by the demon lord.&nbsp;From the presence of the Undying Temple of&nbsp;Kiaransalee, drow goddess of death, in the city below, the heroes deduce that this city is Maerimydra, a settlement somewhere in the Deep Wastes beneath the Dalelands&nbsp;and the Moonsea, far to the east.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
<span class="caps">MISCELLANY</span>&nbsp;<br>
In a flurry of research, the heroes find information on a range of minor topics. Yzak, in his quest to find the so-called "sister sword" of Dawnbringer, learns that a dark blade has been discovered to be the hands of the weapons master of House Melarn, the zealous inquisitors of Lolth in Menzoberranzan. Zap finds that Zellix's Asylum, located between Araj and Menzoberranzan, has recently been discovered as a place where agents of its patron bring patients in from around the madness-inflicted Underdark. As the heroes learn of this place, the echo of another mind flayer, named&nbsp;Xetzirbor, appears in the room and takes an interest in their research. Xetzirbor&nbsp;does not disclose its own timeframe, but does say that it is here to learn how to save a dying elder brain named Cyrog.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Zap also peruses a cartographical&nbsp;section of the library, finding a variety of atlases and&nbsp;gazetteers, as well as maps toward surface routes, giving the heroes a virtually complete image of the Northdark's&nbsp;geography.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">DEMON</span> <span class="caps">LORDS</span><br>
Juiblex&nbsp;the Lord of Slime is glimpsed traveling through the Underdark, surrounded by a coterie of oozes and demons. Some of the Oozing Hunger's minions pounce upon a pair of hapless myconids, and the heroes conclude&nbsp;that Juiblex is pursuing Zuggtmoy's&nbsp;wedding train.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A kuo-toa&nbsp;swimming in the gloomy Darklake&nbsp;turns left and right, trying to find something even as he is surrounded by ixitxachitl. The kuo-toa&nbsp;smiles, its needle teeth gleaming even in the darkness. It has seen something, understands a new secret. Its already unhinged mind plunges further into madness, and the kuo-toa&nbsp;curls in on itself, arms extended in worship. From the circle of demon rays emerge two tentacles, followed by the two howling baboon heads of Demogorgon, or "Leemooggoogoon", the so-called Deep Father of Sloobludop.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Day 181 – Flamerule 18 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">FINAL</span> <span class="caps">RESEARCH</span><br>
The heroes wrap things up in the mystical library of Gravenhollow. Zimmerl&nbsp;hopes for some secrets of greater&nbsp;psionic power, but comes away wanting – the magic of the mind must be unlocked from within. Yzak&nbsp;seeks techniques for demon fighting, and such niceties as how to fight a dragon underwater. The group seeks other examples of Ghazrim&nbsp;DuLoc's&nbsp;direction-finding ring so they might duplicate the wondrous item, but it – a physical representation of the holy symbol of the svirfneblin&nbsp;deity Callurduran Smoothhands – seems to have found its way to their cause all on its own. In an attempt to divine their own future, Yzak tries to find records or predictions of the party's own deeds, but finds little aside from "the wielder of Dawnbringer&nbsp;and his companions face several powerful demons." Likewise, his research on major battles of the Rage of Demons is spotty: given the demons' chaotic and individualistic nature, for the most part they operate in small raiding groups rather than in marching hosts, so skirmishes and guerilla warfare are far more common than pitched battles. Finally, their efforts fail to find a single correct way through the Labyrinth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The sentient library seems to guide the heroes' research toward topics it considers important.&nbsp;When they seek answers regarding <em>faerzress</em>, the heroes find that destroying or "moving" the magical radiation would be nigh impossible without divine intervention or Elven High Magic. <em>Faerzress</em>, they learn, was put into place by elven&nbsp;high mages&nbsp;millennia ago after the dark elves fled into the Underdark, in an effort to prevent them from teleporting back to the surface world. Lastly, in a fleeting glimpse at a possible future, the heroes see Lolth&nbsp;approached by Graz'zt, who asks the Spider Queen to join him in forming a Demon Council to bring some unity of rule to the Abyss. The extraordinary adventurers, recalling Graz'zt's offers of power to them, wonder if there would be any room for mortal heroes on such a council.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">LEAVING</span> <span class="caps">GRAVENHOLLOW</span>&nbsp;<br>
Having had many questions answered and suspicions confirmed&nbsp;at the stone library, the heroes make ready to leave. As they approach the massive doors, they find that the three giant keepers, plus the basilisk Veldyskar&nbsp;and the galeb&nbsp;duhr&nbsp;Hourm, await to see the heroes off with respect. Yzak asks Veldyskar if they can keep one of his scales (in order to more easily <em>teleport </em>back here should they desire to); the guardian basilisk is taken aback by the request but goes to ask the librarians if this is permissible. Urmas&nbsp;and Ustova&nbsp;have already returned to their urgent work, but Ulthar, the Keeper of the Past, remains to answer this query. He gives Veldyskar&nbsp;permission, who then grants the request. The heroes step outside the huge basalt doors under the watchful gaze of the stone golem sentinels. As they step into the open Underdark, Sloopidoop&nbsp;fades into nothingness, the kuo-toa&nbsp;willingly meeting his destiny along with the rest of the doomed Society of Brilliance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yzak&nbsp;immediately checks DuLoc's&nbsp;ring, which he finds still points toward the library, and sees that the doors do indeed still open to his push. These facts confirmed, Yzak&nbsp;activates his <em>Helm of Teleportation</em>, concentrating on the rune sequence grudgingly provided by Vizeran DeVir.</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: The Tower of Vengeance&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="caps">REACHING</span> <span class="caps">ARAJ</span>&nbsp;<br>
As the heroes appear within the teleportation circle, the runes crackle and evaporate. The group has arrived in the Wormwrithings -&nbsp;a region of natural caverns connected by tubular tunnels roughly ten feet in diameter, carved by&nbsp;purple worms ceaselessly burrowing through the porous, regenerating rock that they find irresistible.&nbsp;Meanwhile, a soft purple light emanates from Zimmerl's&nbsp;belt pouch. The quizzical drow&nbsp;opens the pouch and finds that a map of the Wormwrithings&nbsp;has been placed there. Removing it, Zimmerl sees outlined in spidery drow script "Araj" – the drow&nbsp;word for "vengeance" – similarly glowing on a nearby tunnel wall. Pressing the map against the word, the mystic causes a secret door to slide aside, revealing a dark and narrow passage. After an hour of squeezing through this fissure, constantly hearing the echo of distant sounds, the party comes to a natural cavern whose walls glimmer with bits of quartz and mica. There is a footpath worn into the stone floor, at the end of which rises an enormous black stalagmite carved into a bleak tower.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910176/Araj_entry.PNG?1539583508"><br>
<br>
<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br>
Stepping out onto a top-story balcony as the heroes traverse the cavern is Vizeran&nbsp;DeVir. But as the archmage&nbsp;welcomes them to his home, a trio of deadly demons swoops in from a hole near the ceiling on a far wall.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">NABASSU</span> <span class="caps">FIGHT</span>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910180/Nabassu.jpg?1539583695"><br>
<br>
<br>
The gargoyle-like demons swoop down in fury, two flying toward the heroes and&nbsp;ferociously&nbsp;attacking Zimmerl and Yzak, while another falls upon Vizeran&nbsp;on the balcony, dispelling fears that the wizard had laid a trap. Zap recognizes these fiends as nabassu, hated outcasts even among demonkind, for their insatiable hunger for souls crosses an ethical line even by Lower Planar standards. Indeed, their mere gaze undeniably drains the lifeforce, as the heroes quickly learn. Vizeran&nbsp;is sorely wounded by his foeman, but presents a lock of angel hair and speaks some arcane syllables, and the demon is <em>banish</em>ed&nbsp;with a faint popping sound.&nbsp; The other two nabassu&nbsp;prove resilient against Zimmerl's&nbsp;mysticism, but are defeated by pure force of arms. The first to be slain does not melt into Abyssal slime – it falls to the ground as its skin burns away, revealing the muscles and tissue beneath. Yzak&nbsp;makes sure to harvest its eyes, hoping to one day somehow weaponize their soul-stealing nature. The wounded Vizeran&nbsp;steps into his sanctum, motioning for the heroes to enter via the ground floor. The contrary Zap and Yzak fly up on Vesper, but Zimmerl&nbsp;does go in as requested.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ENTERING</span> <span class="caps">ARAJ</span>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910191/Araj_tower.PNG?1539584471"><br>
<br>
Zimmerl goes past the heavy iron door and steps through a short tunnel into a cool, dark chamber. A floating ball of pale violet light brightens before him, revealing an opening in the vaulted ceiling and a spiral stone staircase with no railing, climbing up into the darkness. Around the stairs, the light reveals a broad, circular audience chamber with cold, unlit lanterns hanging from brackets set into the stone wall, heavy carpets covering the smooth floor, and a throne-like chair on a raise dais left of the entry antechamber. The ball of violet light floats to a stop beneath the center of the open shaft – Zimmerl&nbsp;recognizes the shaft from his younger days in the&nbsp;Oblodran compound as a means by which noble drow&nbsp;travel via <em>levitation</em>, and he wills himself upward along with the hovering light. On his way up he sees landings leading to a kitchen, guest bedchambers, a torture chamber, a library and laboratory, Vizeran's&nbsp;private apartments, and other essential facilities. Going up along the spiraling stair is a svirfneblin&nbsp;slave dusting off several suits of decorative armor on display. As Zimmerl&nbsp;reaches Araj's topmost level, the sanctum, he finds Yzak&nbsp;and Zap waiting along with Vizeran&nbsp;DeVir.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">VIZERAN</span>'S&nbsp;<span class="caps">SCHEME</span><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910205/Vizeran_DeVir2.PNG?1539585016"><br>
<br>
Vizeran&nbsp;bids the heroes make themselves comfortable in his sanctum, where he spends his time in contemplation and study. <em>Unseen servants</em> bring trays of dried mushrooms, smoked&nbsp;rothé&nbsp;meat, and goblets of spicy liquor. Also in the room is a much younger drow&nbsp;mage, whom Vizeran&nbsp;introduces as his apprentice Grin Ousstyl, "a clever troublemaker from an out-of-favor house." Vizeran makes a point of pouring a drink and sipping his liquor first. Noticing Zap squint in suspicion, Vizeran&nbsp;scoffs at the notion that he would try to poison his guests, given the extreme trouble he has gone through to arrange this meeting.<br>
<br>
With that settled, everyone sits down and the old wizard continues the discussion they began back at Gravenhollow, saying that his only equal among the drow&nbsp;in the Art is Gromph Baenre, his lifelong rival. But Gromph, as an astute political manipulator and a son of the First House of the Ruling Council of&nbsp;Menzoberranzan, was able to arrange for Vizeran's exile from the city. This ironically possibly saved Vizeran's&nbsp;life, though without his considerable arcane power House DeVir was destroyed by House Do'Urden. Gromph, meanwhile, became Archmage&nbsp;of Menzoberranzan. But this accomplishment was not enough for Gromph, who like Vizeran&nbsp;chafed at the manner in which mages suffered at the hands of the matron mothers and mistresses of the drow. From Araj, Vizeran has watched Gromph's activities for two centuries, no easy task given his target's suspicious and circumspect nature. Nonetheless, Vizeran&nbsp;observed the crafting of a unique ritual – one that somehow drew on <em>faerzress</em>&nbsp;to channel incalculable arcane power. When Gromph performed the ritual, the walls between planes shuddered, and the demon lords were wrenched from the Abyss and cast about the Underdark.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">VIZERAN</span>'S <span class="caps">PLAN</span>&nbsp;<br>
When the heroes do not rebuff his overtures, Vizeran&nbsp;explains his counter to Gromph's&nbsp;failed summoning. Though he knows of no means how it can simply be reversed, he knows of a different means to send the demon lords back to the Abyss.&nbsp;<br>
"Demons are creatures ruled by madness and hatred, even the greatest and most powerful of them. They war ceaselessly upon each other in the Abyss, and have already begun to do so here. We can play them against each other, and then deal with the weakened victors.&nbsp;<br>
"I believe I have the ability to devise and craft a ritual, similar to Gromph's but nowhere near as dangerous or foolish, that will draw the most powerful demon lords together to the site of the original summoning. Once they are brought together, they will try to destroy each other. But though the demon lords might destroy each other's physical manifestations here in our world, their essence cannot be extinguished. They will thus be cast back into the Abyss, as effectively as if they had been banished.&nbsp;<br>
"The ritual needs certain components to produce the talisman that will draw the demons. Then a rite to empower and activate it. Then blood and battle such as this world has never seen. Any survivors among the demon lords will be sorely weakened, and should be far easier to destroy.&nbsp;<br>
"All I need are the necessary ingredients," Vizeran says,"and, ideally, a look at Gromph's&nbsp;grimoires and notes from his sanctum." While the archmage watches the heroes, a thin smile curls one corner of his mouth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When it appears the heroes are willing to ally with him, Vizeran&nbsp;further outlines his needs. He explains that the ritual is powered by a unique talisman that he calls "the <em>dark heart</em>." Zap demands to know if this will have any dangerous or corruptive effects upon them as they carry it, and why it is called by such a wicked&nbsp;name. Vizeran&nbsp;replies that the <em>dark heart</em> will act more as a conduit for power than as a source of it, and so will not carry any risks for its bearers – furthermore, he neither hides nor apologizes for his true drow nature.&nbsp;The talisman's creation will require&nbsp;a number of unique components:&nbsp;<br>
-the intact and unhatched egg of a purple worm, for channeling great physical power<br>
-the central eye of a beholder, to break down magical resistance and overcome magical forces<br>
-six feathers from six different angels – the authority of the celestial realms and a force to enrage fiendish creatures<br>
-the heart of a goristro demon, to reach and influence the hearts of other demons&nbsp;<br>
-thirteen timmasks, also known as "devil's mushrooms", sprouted from the footprint of a Type 5 or 6 demon – such as a&nbsp;marilith, a balor, or a goristro – a lure to draw demons in<br>
-a vial of brine from the pool of an illithid elder brain, to influence minds&nbsp;<br>
-a few drops of blood or ichor from a demon lord, to connect with the demons the ritual will call<br>
-Gromph Baenre's grimoires&nbsp;and notes on his ritual, to assist in better understanding the power that summoned the demon lords&nbsp;<br>
<br>
From a <em>bag of holding</em>, Zimmerl&nbsp;helpfully produces the central eye of Xazax the Eyemonger, which Vizeran notes is complete and well-preserved,&nbsp;and the group has eight of the required&nbsp;thirteen timmasks on hand from their various harvests of fungal groves. They also believe they could summon six angels over six days using Jagh's&nbsp;<em>prayer beads </em>and ask them each for a feather. Meanwhile, Vizeran&nbsp;has located potential sources for all of the components. The purple worm egg and eye of the beholder he has located here in the Wormwrithings, specifically at a worm nursery forty-eight miles to the west of his tower and at the Vast Oblivium some twelve miles south of that nursery. Though the party already has the beholder eye, Zap recalls from a beholder memory viewed 159 days prior via a gas spore fungus. Burning clearly still in his mind from then is a vision of his parents Elroar and Pruanna&nbsp;enslaved by a party of drow&nbsp;holding parley with a beholder named Karazikar. The heroes resolve to go there to find the lost Rowsdowers – and perhaps for a spare beholder eye for their own esoteric purposes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Apart from this, Vizeran&nbsp;declares that the angel feathers and demon heart can be claimed in the Labyrinth. Gromph's grimoire is to be found in Menzoberranzan, specifically in Sorcere, the arcane academy&nbsp; that Gromph is master of as Archmage&nbsp;of the city. The nearest source of elder brain brine is in Cyrog, named for its recently dead (now undead, courtesy of Orcus) elder brain, located in the unfathomable depths of the Clawrift&nbsp;miles beneath Menzoberranzan.&nbsp;Being able to acquire the remaining&nbsp;timmasks and the demon lord blood will depend upon the heroes' opportunities and resourcefulness.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Through conversation with and intuition of the cagey Vizeran, the heroes glean yet more information.&nbsp;Zap believes that Vizeran is sincere in his desire to aid the heroes undo Gromph's&nbsp;folly, albeit for purely selfish reasons. Vizeran&nbsp;does not know what Gromph's intended purpose was, but suspects his rival meant to summon and bind one specific demon lord – surely Gromph&nbsp;was not arrogant enough to think he could bind all of them at once.&nbsp;It was somehow accomplished via the weakening of <em>faerzress</em>, which he says is now serving as a conduit through which insanity spreads as the presence of the demon lords warps the fabric of the Underdark. Vizeran and Zimmerl believe that Lolth&nbsp;herself was behind the plot to bring the demon lords to the Material Plane through her manipulation of Gromph, she using her drow worshippers as pawns to dispose of her demonic rivals and seize power in the Abyss.&nbsp;Zap decides that Vizeran is a bit mad himself, possessed by megalomania and an all-consuming&nbsp;thirst for revenge, but decides that these are not obstacles to their alliance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The heroes agree to search for the ingredients to Vizeran's ritual, to bring the <em>dark heart</em>&nbsp;to Menzoberranzan, and to engage the victor of the resultant battle royale to purge the Underdark of the demon lords. In the meantime, DeVir&nbsp;offers the use of Araj&nbsp;as a safe haven for so long as his alliance with the heroes lasts. The party decides to take advantage of this at once, taking up temporary residence in&nbsp;guest quarters on the tower's&nbsp;third level. As Zimmerl meditates and regains his psionic power, Zap asks for and receives permission to peruse Vizeran's&nbsp;library on the tower's fourth level. Vizeran&nbsp;agrees to tutor the arcane trickster, and when Zap asks for a charm of some kind to keep slain demons' bodies from returning to the Abyss (to facilitate retrieving the goristro heart), the evil&nbsp;archmage is pleased to oblige. When the party reconvenes after their rest, Zimmerl is curious where Vizeran's&nbsp;slaadi&nbsp;bodyguard&nbsp;is to be found; he is not disappointed when the "svirfneblin slave" shapechanges&nbsp;to take his true form as the death slaad&nbsp;Kleve. Vizeran&nbsp;pulls his bodyguard back from his menacing posturing, telling him to be polite to the guests. With the party ready to head out into the Wormwrithings&nbsp;after their brief respite, Vizeran&nbsp;presents them with several items from his treasury to aid in their shared quest and show his good faith, namely a <em>piwafwi</em> (a drowcraft&nbsp;<em>cloak of elvenkind</em>) for each hero, plus amulets that can be used once as a <em>scroll of protection from fiends. </em>Finally, with the heroes dismayed that they have no way to conveniently and easily&nbsp;return here, Vizeran&nbsp;reluctantly has the <em>unseen servants</em> pull aside the luxurious rug in his study, revealing the teleportation circle hidden beneath that will allow them to directly travel to his sanctum. The archmage makes clear that this privilege is for them alone, and if they should abuse it their alliance shall be at an end.&nbsp;So prepared, the heroes set forth.<em>&nbsp;</em><br>
<br>
Chapter Thirteen: The Wormwrithings<br>
<br>
Day 182 – Flamerule 19&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910291/Wormwrithings.PNG?1539593019"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">PURPLE</span> <span class="caps">WORM</span> <span class="caps">BREACH</span><br>
After a day of walking through the cylindrical tunnels of the Wormwrithings, the tunnel wall to the party's left breaks open as a gargantuan worm chews through the solid rock.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910278/PurpleWorm1.jpg?1539592031"><br>
<br>
The purple worm strikes without warning or mercy, with rock shrapnel spraying from the tunnel wall. And yet despite all this, the worm's tremorsense&nbsp;did not detect the flying heroes (by Vesper or by <em>broom</em>), and it did not have them at an advantage. After deflecting the initial shock, Zimmerl is able to telepathically crush the worm, using his psionic might against the intellectual pygmy. The other heroes are able to pile on their attacks; despite the monster getting a new chance to break its enchantment every time it is dealt wounds, the worm is simply too stupid to break free. It is slain without injury to the party, apart from the superficial wounds caused by&nbsp;the worm crashing through the rock.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">TROGLODYTE</span> <span class="caps">LAIR</span>&nbsp;<br>
After twenty-four miles of travel, halfway between Araj and the worm nursery, the party's scouts encounter a foul stench and a cacophony of faint, hissing voices rising from ahead. The cylindrical, rubble-filled tunnel plunges sharply downward into a large, open cavern dimly lit by luminous fungi and bisected by an underground stream. The cave houses about thirty tall reptilian humanoids; from their build and the awful musk the heroes recognize them as troglodytes.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910363/Troglodyte.PNG?1539623955"><br>
<br>
<br>
The simpleminded brutes&nbsp;stand on either side of the stream in two rough lines of battle, waving makeshift weapons and howling threats at each other in their own hissing language. The group of troglodytes closest to the heroes has a captive of their own race lashed between two stalagmites atop a low rise in the cavern floor. The creatures are preoccupied with their conflict and do not notice the heroes immediately. Zimmerl&nbsp;considers just going around them, but the ranger&nbsp;Yzak knows this will add almost fifty miles onto their trip to the worm nursery.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Though none of the adventurers are fluent in the troglodytes' degenerate tongue, they quickly get a general sense of what is causing the conflict. One troglodyte wearing an ornate headdress – apparently their chieftain – is wildly swinging about a sword that is far beyond the craft of any of the other savage&nbsp; warriors' crude clubs or spears. A well-muscled troglodyte is at the center of the other tribal faction, leading his followers in taunting and insulting the others, holding hostage the mate of his chieftain.<br>
<br>
After a few moments of verbal assault, the troglodytes turn violent. The rebel leader holding the hostage orders his warriors to attack, rushing across the stream and raining javelins upon the chieftains forces from atop the rise with the hostage. The rebel then grabs his hostage, dragging her across the stream and threatening to kill her unless the chieftain meets him in battle. Meanwhile six cavalry mounted on giant lizards run along the cavern walls from a side cavern and attack the rebels from behind.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Zimmerl&nbsp;thinks back to his schooling and recalls that troglodytes worship Laogzed&nbsp;the Devourer, a lizard-toad&nbsp;demigod of gluttony and wanton destruction who slumbers in the Abyss. Though Laogzed&nbsp;is not a demon lord, perhaps his loathsome worshippers have nonetheless&nbsp;been drawn to the sites of demonic activity. From hiding, Zimmerl uses a favorite trick, in turn telepathically contacting both the hostage-holding rebel leader and the embattled chieftain and&nbsp;claiming to be their&nbsp;monstrous god, overawing them into telling their warriors to stand down. Zimmerl learns that the chieftain, S'slaar, has claimed a magic sword as a trophy&nbsp;from a defeated party of drow. His war marshal H'slaat, however, is the one who killed the drow leader and demands to wield the sword himself. H'slaat&nbsp;captured the chieftain's mate H'hoort, blossoming the disagreement into bloody conflict. Zimmerl, as Laogzed, commands the two to fight in single combat rather than spend the blood of their tribe on this petty squabble. Neither is to use the enchanted blade in the duel, giving a distinct advantage to the champion H'slaat, who opens the fight by hawking a glob of acidic spittle in the chieftain's face.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">CLAIMING</span> <span class="caps">DUSKBRINGER</span>&nbsp;<br>
Zap lowers a rope from Vesper's back, shimmying down from the stalactites as the tribe's focus is turned upon the field of honor, snagging the disputed sword from under their snouts. The heroes sneak to a smaller chamber to investigate the weapon further. Zap senses a strong personality emanating from the sentient longsword, which he hands to Yzak. Its crossguard&nbsp;is shaped like a stylized spider with tiny gems for eyes, and etched onto the black scabbard in obsidian are the drow words <em>Oloth&nbsp;tlu malla</em>, which means "Darkness be praised."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yzak&nbsp;"thinks out loud"&nbsp;to the item knowing it will hear his thoughts, and asks&nbsp;if it is called "Duskbringer," recalling that the sword was said to be in the hands of the drow&nbsp;House Melarn. It replies that is has been called as that by some. The sword is dismissive of Yzak's&nbsp;attempts to assert mastery over it, considering him as just one more wielder in a long succession of swordsmen stretching back to the ancient past. Duskbringer&nbsp;is an eater of souls, nihilistically believing that all matter sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it – it embraces its own purpose in in hurrying that process along. It has also consumed the souls of several of its own wielders over the years, and makes it clear it would think nothing of doing the same to Yzak.<br>
<br>
Accustomed to being obeyed, the imperious blade demands it be fed a soul at least once every three days, lest it cease to function. Also, though the sword can cast <em>haste</em> on its bearer and maintain the concentration for him, it will only do so at its own whim, if he acts in a sufficiently bloodthirsty manner.&nbsp;Yzak&nbsp;tries to make it clear who is the master in this relationship, but the weapon scoffs, saying that he is a passing moment in its long life, and there is no oblivion the heroes can threaten it with that it does not already know. Yzak&nbsp;then threatens to send it to the desolate&nbsp;surface of the moon where there are no souls to be found, or even the nothingness of the space between worlds – Duskbringer&nbsp;responds by telling the kobold to look upon its blade, seeing that it shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. This fate, it claims, would be akin to going home.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/910371/Blackrazor.jpg?1539629156"><br>
<br>
Coveting the sword's soul-hunting ability to sense living beings, and especially the potentially&nbsp;huge boost to the wielder's hardiness resultant of devouring souls, Yzak&nbsp;turns for a moment to converse with Dawnbringer. The goodly blade of light speaks warily of her dark brother, saying that it would be a corrupting force best not wielded at all. Yzak makes the point, however, that Duskbringer&nbsp;would possibly be able to devour the souls even of demon lords, and Dawnbringer&nbsp;admits that it would be selfish of her to demand&nbsp; to be wielded if the Abyssal princes' true destruction could be achieved with this evil blade. If Yzak's spirit can hold fast against the soul devourer, then, Dawnbringer&nbsp;admits that, if wielded with caution, her dark brother could be a force for good. With only one obstacle remaining, Yzak then asks if Duskbringer would have to be reforged by a master smith, but the weapon, seemingly forged of solidified void, shortens itself by sheer force of personality&nbsp;to fit the kobold's stature and preferred finesse-based fighting style. Inheritor of the dual swords of light and dark, Yzak&nbsp;now stands arrayed for the coming final battle on whatever terms he decides to claim for his own. Perhaps he shall not be so different from the soul-eating nabassu, miserable&nbsp;pariahs even among the tanar'ri.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
Day 182 – Flamerule 19 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<span class="caps">SETTING</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span><br>
With Yzak's&nbsp;standoff done against his new blade Duskbringer, Zimmerl notes that the troglodyte&nbsp;<br>
skirmish sounds like it has died down. The perceptive drow notes a passage blocked by rubble north of a quipper spawning pool and some geothermic vents;&nbsp;the heroes quickly clear this tunnel. Disregarding the northern exit tunnel in favor of fully exploring this cave complex, the heroes cross the main cavern toward the eastern grottoes, flying among the stalactites on the edge of the troglodytes' awareness.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/923007/Troglodyte_Lair.PNG?1543647444"><br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ROPER</span> <span class="caps">AMBUSH</span><br>
As the party careens through the cavern, not one but two stalagmites reveal their true nature as ropers, sprouting wicked tendrils that lash out to draw in unsuspecting prey. Zimmerl fits this category least of all, with his awareness now mystically enhanced so that he cannot be surprised. Zap is pulled into the center of the cavern into the feckless assault of the ropers' piercer young, removing his deadly blades from the fight. The seasoned adventurers make short work of these monstrosities, with Yzak's&nbsp;Duskbringer&nbsp;drinking in the soul of one, bolstering the kobold's own cultivated toughness with the roper's vitality.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With the ropers dead, the heroes note the primitive javelins and warhorn littering the cave floor – possessions of devoured troglodytes. Cutting open the ropers' gizzards, the heroes find some platinum pieces and a <em>ring of protection, </em>as well as some spell scrolls on a dead drow nearby.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">CAPTIVES</span> &amp; <span class="caps">SUPPLIES</span>&nbsp;<br>
Checking out a steam vent to the south, Zap notes a vein of carnelian nearby. Dodging around the gout of steam, the enterprising svirfneblin is able to pick off one gemstone with his endweomered dagger. As the party checks their <em>Bag of Holding</em> inventory for mining equipment more suited to heavy labor, Zimmerl&nbsp;hears grim Dwarvish voices issuing from a pit to the west, saying something about not wanting to go into a lizard's belly. Flying up to a better vantage point, Zimmerl&nbsp;notes not only four captive shield dwarves, but also two silent drow males. All six are haggard and malnourished. As the psionicist&nbsp;lands dramatically in the pit, the surprised dwarves prepare to defend themselves. Zap pokes his head over the ledge and recognizes one of them, Dauthorn Brightmantle, as a prospector from Mithral Hall, and this unexpected meeting helps to defuse matters. Dauthorn&nbsp;says that he led the group here in search of mineral wealth, but became hopelessly lost in the worm tunnels before being captured by the troglodyte tribe. Two of their kin have been devoured by the humanoids in recent days, and the survivors had resolved to go out fighting. The drow males – commoners named&nbsp;Rinil and Xol – both claim allegiance to the inquisitorial House Melarn, and promise aid to Zimmerl should they cross paths in Menzoberranzan. The two drow flee into the Wormwrithings&nbsp;as soon as they are free of the pit.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">DRIDER</span> <span class="caps">DUEL</span>&nbsp;<br>
As Dauthorn&nbsp;readies his mining pick to help retrieve the other gemstones, a nearby tunnel is suddenly cleared of debris as a group of four driders&nbsp;bursts into the cavern.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/923010/Drider2.jpg?1543652359"><br>
<br>
One of the driders&nbsp;bears the trappings of a priestess of Lolth, but their leader is one who sports wounds that obviously should have been mortal – Nar’dorltyrr, weapons master of House Melarn, has apparently been revived by the Spider Queen's spiteful power after being cut down by the treacherous troglodytes. Nar'dorltyrr&nbsp;challenges Yzak for the right to bear Duskbringer&nbsp;- the sword itself agrees with this idea, in fact threatening to never wield its magic for Yzak's&nbsp;cause again if he does not prove himself the greater swordsman here and now. The kobold tosses the sword of void to Nar'dorltyrr&nbsp;and ignites Dawnbringer for himself. As the two combatants circle one another, looking for any weakness or advantage, Jagh asks if he may <em>bless</em> Yzak&nbsp;with a prayer bead, which&nbsp;the Melarni priestess promises would be followed by her own bolstering. Thus the other heroes and driders&nbsp;simply form a mute circle around the two belligerents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Duskbringer&nbsp;uses its own concentration to cast a <em>haste</em> spell upon&nbsp;Nar’dorltyrr, making him difficult to hit as well as increasing the tempo of his already blistering pace of attack. Despite being near-blinded by the sunlight of Dawnbringer, the elite undead drider&nbsp;is still able to score at least one blow per attack routine due to the sheer number of sword strokes. Duskbringer&nbsp;contacts Yzak&nbsp;mentally, promising him that if the drider should strike him down, Yzak's soul will be just as readily consumed as any other victim's.&nbsp;As the kobold's&nbsp;wounds add up, he gives as much as he gets, but Nar’dorltyrr&nbsp;gets his second wind, and then exploits his newfound undead nature by cutting his thumb open with Duskbringer, finding the dark blade soothing. Although his fighting style is severely hampered without his companion Vesper aiding him, Yzak&nbsp;ultimately proves the tougher combatant, and wins the fight through bloody attrition. The other Melarni&nbsp;driders&nbsp;turn dejectedly toward Menzoberranzan&nbsp;as Yzak asserts his dominance over Duskbringer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">ANGEL</span> OF <span class="caps">DEATH</span><br>
The duel done, Dauthorn&nbsp;and the other shield dwarves (Traldak Xornbane, Zulia&nbsp;Stonewhisper, and Hargritt Hammerhome) ransack the troglodytes' supplies, arming themselves with maces, javelins, and four casks of wine. Zap cracks the lock to a tribute chest containing a magical drow dagger, a <em>potion of gaseous form</em>, and other valuables. Determining that the troglodytes are too evil and degenerate to be allowed to live, Yzak&nbsp;has Zimmerl&nbsp;place a globe of <em>darkness</em> around him and puts his training against humanoids to great use, flying into the main cave with terrible wrath. The war marshal H'slaat&nbsp;has slain his chieftain and is now leading the depleted survivors of both sides, but none are spared from the judgment of Yzak. After&nbsp;H'slaat and his most loyal warriors are cut down the others of the tribe break, but Yzak mercilessly pursues them upon Vesper, slaying troglodytes wherever his ranger-trained senses&nbsp;can find them.<br>
<br>
Returning to the party, Yzak&nbsp;undergoes a quick errand of mercy, using his <em>Helm of Teleportation</em> to bring Dauthorn and the other dwarven prospectors to safety among their kin in&nbsp;Gauntlgrym, the dwarves admitting they had proved less skillful&nbsp;than the svirfneblin&nbsp;who scour the worm droppings for valuable gems. After conducting some minor business in the dwarf city, Yzak&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;it to them to decide to remain there among Bruenor's folk or to return to Mithral&nbsp;Hall: the dwarves swear fealty to the fledgling Clan Velkynvelve. With that the heroes leave the troglodyte lair behind and follow the tunnels toward the worm nursery described by Vizeran DeVir.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A <span class="caps">VOICE</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DARK</span><br>
After eighteen miles of vigorous flying, the heroes happen upon a small vaulted cavern opened up by a rockfall. Apart from the occasional glowing insect scuttling along the walls, the cavern is dark. Suddenly, a loud voice booms out in Undercommon: "Turn back or suffer a death so horrible you cannot imagine! You have been warned!". Zimmerl recognizes this for one of his own favorite tricks – supernaturally impersonating a powerful being. The mystic boldly moves forward, his dark elven&nbsp;eyesight spotting a fellow drow&nbsp;- a young female, perhaps twenty – hiding with mediocre talent among the rubble. She abjures herself with&nbsp;<em>mage armor</em>&nbsp;as he notices&nbsp;her.&nbsp;As Zimmerl presses ahead, he sees her mouthing words as the voice – a <em>minor illusion</em> – shouts out again "Fools! Flee now! This is your final warning!". Calling directly to the other drow, Zimmerl&nbsp;is given a warning shot at his feet – a <em>ray of frost</em> – as she threatens to destroy the party with her "powerful magic." The rest of the party, amused at this mageling's defiance, now confidently join their mystic. The drow, embarrassed, arises from her hiding spot and after some prodding introduces herself as Hanne&nbsp;Hallen, an ally of House Mizzrym. Hanne's mother, Zhora Hallen, leads the Dark Hunters – drow explorers who steal purple worm eggs, prized by wizards for their arcane rituals. Hanne&nbsp;was on her first egg run when a passing purple worm burst into the tunnel they were traveling through. Hanne is convinced that her mother and the rest of the team are dead, and the headstrong and half-starved apprentice is attempting to make her way back to Menzoberranzan. Yzak&nbsp;asks if she could bring the heroes back to the worm nursery, which she agrees to do for the small price of some food and a waterskin.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">FINDING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WORM</span> <span class="caps">NURSERY</span>&nbsp;<br>
Six miles later, the heroes are nearing the appointed place when the tunnel they are in begins to shake and rumble. Suddenly the floor gives way – but Hanne, the only landborne&nbsp;traveler, is saved from the fall by the swooping beastmaster Yzak. Though the offending worm's tunnel collapses behind it as it chews through the rock, a natural cavern has been revealed by the breaking ground. After finding a fungus cave and a mysterious&nbsp;ossuary carpeted by thousands of bones – some recognizable such as elf, dwarf, or goblin, but others strange and unidentifiable – the heroes find a small side chamber featuring a very deep pit, extending beyond even the superior darkvision of drow&nbsp;and svirfneblin. Thirty feet down is a small ledge holding the skeletal remains of a moon elf adventurer clad in moldering leather. Zimmerl flies down upon his broom, finding a <em>ring of free action</em> upon one bony finger. Zap then gives the mystic one of his signature ball-bearings, which Zimmerl&nbsp;places a psionic sensor upon before dropping it down the chasm, judging it to descend a thousand feet.<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EGG</span> <span class="caps">CHAMBER</span><br>
As the mystic and rogue explore the chasm, Jagh stands watch in the ossuary. Heralded by a low rumbling sound, one of the gargantuan monstrosities known as purple worms moves into the chamber via the same entry cavern, lunging forward with surprising speed&nbsp;by compressing and expanding its&nbsp;massive bulk. The monster either ignores or does not notice Jagh in his earth elemental form, going to burrow through the wall opposite the chasm cavern. The heroes decide not to interfere with the worm (yet), electing to see where it's heading.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Following this force of nature at a careful distance, the party goes through this new worm tunnel to emerge in an expansive cavern featuring clusters of the creatures' eggs – silvery spheres three feet in diameter – cemented together and anchored to the cavern walls with strands of the worms' resinous saliva. Seven clusters hold six eggs each, of which the heroes need only one for&nbsp;Vizeran to fashion his planned&nbsp;<em>dark heart</em> talisman. Hanne Hallen, too, vows not to leave without an egg of her own.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Zap borrows Vesper and stealthily mounts one of the egg clusters, using his dagger to spend several minutes carefully hacking out a couple of eggs without the worm noticing, during which time a second purple worm slithers through the southern tunnel into the chamber and after a quick circling of the room&nbsp;begins chewing through the eastern wall, opposite the heroes' entry point. As Zap is about to return to the others and declare victory, he barely notices a band of eleven stealthy drow&nbsp;entering the egg chamber via the same southern tunnel the last worm had used. After Zap warns the others via Zimmerl's telepathic network, Hanne sees them too, and immediately recognizes the Dark Hunters: her mother is still alive.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">DARK</span> <span class="caps">HUNTERS</span>&nbsp;<br>
The heroes and Hanne&nbsp;quietly make their way south, warily approaching the drow band even as one of the Dark Hunters has slowly shimmied up a strand of hardened worm saliva to begin cutting out the profitable eggs. Hanne&nbsp;and her mother Zhora, who likewise had thought her daughter dead, share a quiet moment of reunion. The brief tenderness fades as Zhora&nbsp;demands to know if the heroes have treated her daughter well. There is an instant of tension as the heroes fear drow treachery, but Hanne&nbsp;indeed vouches for them, and Zhora gravely promises that she will repay this debt however she can.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the well-educated Hanne&nbsp;knows quite a bit about purple worms, and as she recovers from the emotional reunion the young mage recognizes that they are standing just outside&nbsp;an echo chamber, a defensive structure hollowed out by the worms and connected via resinous strands that reverberate and hum throughout the entire nursery, warning the worms of trespassers. As the heroes and Dark Hunters prepare to quietly exit into the greater&nbsp;Wormwrithings&nbsp;with their ovular prizes, they are dismayed when the warty and misshapen face of a fomorian, the hideous and wicked fey-cursed giants of the Underdark, shows itself bleary-eyed as the deformed wretch trudges sleepily into the echo chamber. As the companions' eyes widen, the fomorian&nbsp;shouts "Stronk kill egg thieves!" in Undercommon, having apparently somehow entered into a symbiotic relationship with the worms. As the vile brute bears down on Yzak&nbsp;with his greatclub, his bellowing alerts the worms to the party's presence.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/923333/fomorian.jpg?1543728564"><br>
<br>
Yzak&nbsp;engages the fomorian Stronk, with the giant's evil eye latently sharing the pain and malice of it's race's curse with the hero, whose mind is pained by the imagery along with the great crushing blows of the giant's club. Meanwhile one purple worm moves against the other heroes, as another swallows one Dark Hunter in a maw wide enough to engulf a&nbsp;rothé as it&nbsp;impales another with his gigantic tail stinger. Worse, the telltale rumblings of another burrowing worm shake the nursery.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/200482/assets/923006/Purple_Worm.jpeg?1543647377"><br>
<br>
Zhora&nbsp;Hallen, an elite warrior, draws her sword and stands alongside the heroes as her team withdraws, firing hand crossbows and laying down a blanket of <em>darkness</em> to cover their escape – though the tremorsensing&nbsp;worms are little affected by this standard drow tactic, and their prodigious constitutions easily shrug off the sleep poison. A third purple worm breaks through the wall to join the melee, sorely pressing Yzak, who still battles Stronk&nbsp;as the fomorian "protects his precious ones."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Dark Hunters limn the ferocious worms with <em>faerie fire</em> before making good their escape, granting the heroes that extra edge they need to hit their foes. Zimmerl&nbsp;pours on raw psionic power as Zap and Jagh fight in concert to take down one worm at a time, Vesper flitting from fight to fight to aid as needed as the beastmaster Yzak&nbsp;engages the fomorian. Stronk&nbsp;falls to Duskbringer, bringing the coveted fomorian vigor to its wounded master, who is a bit resentful that the enchanted sword had&nbsp;already bestowed&nbsp;its daily <em>haste</em> spell upon another wielder. With each enemy defeated, the heroes breathe that much easier, but never is it an easy or foregone match – even a single purple worm is a devastating sight to behold, and three in defense of their young alongside a horrible fomorian&nbsp;is a physical and emotional imposition the likes of which the heroes have not seen before. Finally the third purple worm crashes limply to the cavern floor, quite dead. The astonished Dark Hunters creep back into the nursery to behold the heroes' handiwork and retrieve their desired treasures.&nbsp;</p>

The heroes are barely able to save Jagh, whom they need to teleport away – Zimmerl is <em>feebleminded</em> and&nbsp;Yzak dies in the delaying action against Demogorgon.&nbsp;Carrying the fallen kobold, the surviving heroes, their gang of followers, and a score of kuo-toa (including Ploop's son Glooglugogg)&nbsp;teleport via a bank of coral&nbsp; to Neverlight&nbsp;Grove's southern terrace.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Greeting a startled&nbsp;Rasharoo, the heroes continue on to the joint&nbsp;sovereigns, but hold off on any sidequests or exploring until they have&nbsp;rested. Glabagool asks if bats are mouse angels. Zap uses the recently-stolen scroll of raise dead to return Yzak's soul from Tymora's realm, and Jagh prepares a heal spell to cure Zimmerl's condition. After resting, Sarith demands to accompany the heroes to speak with the myconid&nbsp;kings. Though Zimmerl had been considering removing the drow's&nbsp;infection of Zuggtmoy's tainted spores, he decides against it, and indeed Yzak murders the murderer in an out-of-the-way spot in the grove. Zimmerl psionically tricks Phylo into taking all of his infected followers on a jaunt a quarter mile west of the colony, which they do despite their societal structure. The heroes have a secret talk with Basidia, who urges them to investigate the eastern plateau and strange behavior of Phylo. The heroes then sneak up on Phylo's exodus, where Jagh devastates the myconids with ice storm and wall of fire. Returning to the haven, Basidia is unenthused about their bloody tactics, but accepts that sometimes cleansing flames are needed to remove infections. When the heroes slay troublesome monsters he can turn into spore servants, Basidia gives them various treasures as reward, and promises to brew whatever potions they may require. Zimmerl tips their time-traveling hand, and Basidia doubts the veracity of his knowledge – how could he know such things? The titanic fungal tower of Yggmorgus&nbsp;looms not so far away, containing Zuggtmoy herself, and the madness of her court which she is already setting up on this plane.<br>

On the way back he&nbsp;sneaks up on Fargas on the Silken Paths (and a still-living elf companion); Yzak tries to frighten off these adventurers from the tomb&nbsp;but his deception fails. Meanwhile&nbsp;Zimmerl&nbsp;finds the&nbsp;sentinel shield in the otyugh's offal mound near Neverlight. The heroes&nbsp;return to&nbsp;Neverlight and burn down Yggmorgus&nbsp;after a blight casting from Jagh; as Zuggtmoy emerges they teleport via plants&nbsp;to Entemoch's Boon and get basilisk eggs (hatch in 5 months).&nbsp;<br>

Day 18 – Alturiak 8 (cont.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
To shut keep Ghazrim DuLoc quiet after Jagh's revelations to the Zhent&nbsp;negotiator about future developments, the party decides to silence him permanently. This will also remove DuLoc as a possible rival to&nbsp;the potentially Bregan D'aerthe-aligned drow emissary the heroes plan to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the wilds of the Underdark, Yzak guides the group to a side passage that connects with the Zhentarim passage to the surface. Jagh knocks down their constructed wall, and soon Zap has sneaked into Ghazrim's quarters, surrounded by his macabre pickled collection of malformed fetuses. Posing as a Zhent agent sent from Luskan&nbsp;by&nbsp;Davra Jassur, Zap gains Ghazrim's trust before murdering him. Going into the Zhentarim warehouse, Zap lures the maimed beholder Lorthuun to the same room, where a silence spell from Yzak prevents sound of battle from pouring into the enclave as they destroy Ghazrim's co-leader, taking the aberration's central eye for use in Vizeran DeVir's ritual.<br>
<br>
Zap creates an illusion of a glabrezu rampaging out of the Zhent enclave into Mantol-Derith's main cavern, the heroes making a show of vanquishing said fiend and loudly blaming Menzoberranzan's&nbsp;chief negotiator SIrak Mazelor for summoning it, and broadly the drow&nbsp;for the demonic incursion at large.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mazelor&nbsp;and her elite guards bristle at these accusations, and battle the heroes. During the fighting the assassin Kinyel Druu'giir sees her chance and turns her cloak, helping the heroes kill Sirak and seizing power for herself. Kinyel vows not to allow any "puppets of House Baenre" control of the drow enclave, and that she will hold the enclave in trust until a "rightful representative" is sent to take command. The heroes also deign to give Zilchyn Q'leptin one of the Pudding King's spellbooks as a sign of good faith.<br>
