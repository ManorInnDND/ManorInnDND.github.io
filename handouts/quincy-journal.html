			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Most of the journal is about Quincy's trouble with finding good help and complaints about an aging body. There are a few passages however that are interesting:

				...I forgot the tune for the organ again and decided to earmark the page though guests aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t as impressed when I have to go grab the book in the middle of dinner...
				<br>
				...Murdol has begun preparing my meals per my new regimen, the ingredients cost a fortune being magical so I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have him hide them in unassuming containers to keep my less trustworthy help put of trouble....

			</p>
			<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
