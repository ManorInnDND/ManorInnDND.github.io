				<h3>General Features</h3>
				The town is built within the ruins, many areas still dangerous, and has some quirks unique to towns of deep gnomes.
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Chambers.</span> Blingdenstone is not a single cavern, but a network of interconnected caves
					and pockets the deep gnomes have widened and worked into homes, workshops, vending stalls, storerooms, and the like. Other
					than residential caverns, all chambers are tall enough for medium creatures to walk about in without trouble. 
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Many Stairs.</span> Larger caverns are rarely bare, with stone stairs and bridges crisscrossing 
					creating access to tunnels high above the cavern floor.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Light.</span>The caverns of the inner town are brightly lit with a mix of bioluminscent fungi, caged
					giant fire beetles, and magic. The light from these chambers spills into short connecting tunnels lacking their own illumination 
					creating areas of dim light. Longer tunnels have their own light sources.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Connecting Tunnels.</span> Deep gnomes and other small races can walk without difficulty, but 
					larger creatures must duck and squeeze- a feature intended to control invaders' movements. Most tunnels have smooth floors 
					but those near the edges of the reclaimed areas are strewn with rubble and dust. Many tunnels incorporate traps such as collapsing
					ceilings or floor, or allow for flooding, but the traps are not currently active. 
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Doors.</span> Most doors in the town are finely constructed, with adamantine and steel inlays making 
					them incredibly resiliant to forced entry.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					About 300 deep gnomes inhabit the ruins of the once-secret town of Blingdenstone, which was 
					destroyed by a drow invasion 50 years ago. In the last decade deep gnomes have returned to the 
					ruins to resettle and established themselves in the residences near the town's main entrance. 
					The rest of the town's neighboorhoods are sealed off, deemed uninhabitable due to varied dangers.
				</p>
				<h3>Personages</h3>
				A few prominent deep gnomes take an interest in the party and may have tasks for them.
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Dorbo Diggermattock.</span> Dorbo is king of the deep gnomes and is 
					in charge of the mining operations in the surrouding areas. He is particularly lean for a deep gnome
					and has a piercing gaze. 
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Senni Diggermattock.</span> Senni is queen of Blingdenstone and is in
					charge of the political and general social affairs of the town and its settlers. She is also lean, 
					like her husband, and is likewise stern. 
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Kazook Pickshine.</span> Short and pudgy, Kazook is an esteemed merchant in Blingdenstone,
					with contracts among the duerger of Gracklestugh and the shield dwarves of Mithral Hall. Like all 
					deep gnomes he deals in gems, but also trades exotic ores and herbs. He is a distinguised alchemist as well. 
					Kazook is the only male merchant in Blingdenstone, his time exploring outside the town having broadened his 
					mind.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Barrow Warden Jadger.</span> Jadger is the ghost of a deep gnome veteran who 
					died defending the town during the drow assault 50 years ago. He presents an unpleasant aspect as his head
					is split nearly in two, and one half of his face droops with palsy.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Glyphic Shroombright.</span> Glyphic is the solicitous head priest of the temple
					to Callurdan Stonehands in Blingdenstone. He fidgets often and seems obssesed with candles, specifically ensuring 
					that they are burning down evenly with respect to their neighbors.
				</p>
				<h3>Locales</h3>
				Several of the caverns have features of interest to an adventuring group.
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Traders Grotto.</span> After visiting the Blaze Bazaar in Gracklestugh this place
					seems megre. However the five merchant stalls here provide a variety of goods, most imported from without the town
					and marked up 10-25%. The merchants are all female with the exception of Kazook.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">The Ruby in the Rough.</span> The large chamber is a holy site for the deep gnomes and 
					is a temple dedicated to Segojan Earthcaller, the svirfneblin god of nature and deep earth. The temple is run by 
					Glyphic Shroombright. A large passage on one of its walls leads to the vast catacombs which house the dead of Blingdenstone.
				</p>
				<h3>Outskirts</h3>
				These caverns near the town may be of interest.
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Whiteshell Mine.</span> Blingdenstone's largest salt mine is half a day outside of the town.
					Baldini believes his blacksalt mine might one day rival Whiteshell.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Pickshine Mines.</span> A secret area near Blingdenstone rumored to have rich veins of precious
					metals and caverns of gems.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Stoneheart Quarry.</span> A faerzress saturated cavern where earth elementals are summoned to aid
					the settlers.
