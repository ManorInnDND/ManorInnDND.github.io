				Seven Moons - Dicates of Ahm
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				The ball of flesh and parchment mewls to your cat-mind of a pleasing paradise, a place of endless tangles of thread, small bugs, fish,
				and shiny stones. Seven Moons has a palace here, a secret forgotten place, his ancestral birthright. The voice is that of Ahm, a great
				sage and worthy advisor to the seven-moons clan. He has led your people to greatness and is owed your allegiance. 
			</p>
			<h2>The Book has a task for you...</h2>
			<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
				Most esteemed of felines, Seven-Moons, may your whiskers ever quiver and your eyes ever sparkle. I must relate to you 
				a terrible truth, a usurper to your birthright exists in this foul city, has taken asylum here. His wretched form
				must be purified to ensure the stability of your most sacred realm. He must incorporate my our truth into his 
				system if your palace is to remain safe. Feed me to him and all will be well. He is a scaled one, and cowers
				behind the name of Kinerth. Make sure he eats every page!
			</p>
			<h2>What this means</h2>
			<p class="Core">
				The voice wants you to force the dragonborn that Onnie hired to make her lance to eat it. Disobeying or delaying more than a day may be 
				unpleasant. You are hearing the voice of a sage who calls himself Ahm, and he has promised to lead you to your ancestral homeland (you being
				Seven-Moons).This is a form of madness, it can be cured like Tyler was or through magic, though you currently identify as Seven-Moons and don't
				know you are mad. If you are presented with information suggesting you are insanse can remake your wisdom save one time, DC 20. If you fail you 
				remain Seven-Moons indefinitely, though you may attempt to act as though you think you are Seven-Stars if you wish.
