				Silverymoon - Your Party's General Knowledge
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Below is general information about the town you already know. If you have further questions you can ask about 
				a subject and one of you may know more with a successful roll (typically history roll)
			</p>
			<h2>Introduction <a href="#tldr">TLDR</a></h2>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Silverymoon looks more like a series of gardens or forest glades than a stone city, and thanks to all the growing
				things, it reeks less than most settlements a third its size. It's also quieter, thanks tothe gentle breezes and 
				sound-muting properties of the protective wards, which also protect the city from extremes of weather. A series 
				of dwarf-built cisterns, pumps and piping ensure the city has flushed privies and ample fresh water for 
				drinking and gardening. 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				The lush beauty of the city and its many forest districts make it easy for newcomers to become lost. Thankfully, Silvaeren
				don't mind offering directions, and every cistern cover in the cobbles of an intersection has an arrow graven into it, pointing 
				north.
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Most city buildings have cellars, and four or even five floors above them, but the trees and gently rolling landscaping make
				the spires of Silverymoon less imposing than similar size structures in other cities. The older path of the city is Northbank,
				and the newer, still expanding area is Southbank. A magical bridge of force spans the river between these parts, called... the 
				Moonbridge. Four gates lead out of the city: Moorgate leads northwest, Hunter's Gate north (into the Moonwood), Sundabar gate to 
				the east, and New Gate to the south. 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				In Silverymoon knowledge is highly valued. Most folk find satisfaction in being well informed in at least one field, and Silvaeren 
				love witty sayings, sharing jokes, lore, music, readings of ballads, poems, and romantic fiction; most attend revels or private 
				dances and feasts three days of the week. They tend to dabble in many interests so shops alternate often, but the small, cozy 
				botuiqes are always crammed with beautiful, fascinating objects, small magics, books, and maps.
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Unquestionably the foremost center of learning and culture in the North, Silverymoon is a happy place where people of many 
				races (surface good-aligned humanoids) dwell in peace. Much of the feeling of peace and goodwill is due to the influence
				of powerful local mages and the Harpers. Both forces are joined in the lady who shaped modern Silverymoon, Alustriel, known
				to Silvaeren as Lady Hope.
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Alustriel prefers to keep people happy and hopeful thorugh enlightened rule, but recognizes intrigue and evil deeds are 
				unaviodable and has an efficient cadre of spies and agents to guard against such influences. The city's army, the Knights in Silver,
				patrol the lands 7 day's ride outside the city to the south and east.

				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Naturalist Architecture.</span> Though bustling, the city's architects have adhered to a 
					sustainable ethos throughout its expansion. Towering oaks, slender spires, and mage-sculpted stone buildings crowd the 
					city's avenues and most of the flagstone streets are shaded by blueleaf elms. Many of the older buildings are clad in a thin layer of 
					fused royal blue or emerald green glass. Balconies and curving stairs are everywhere, with windowsills, railings, and eaves adorned with
					herbs and flowers suspended in sculpted bowls.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Magical Wards</span> The city is protected by ovular wards extending several hundred feet 
					beyond it's outer walls. The wards emit a faint, predominantly pink, irridescence. The extent of the ward's effects are secret
					but they are known to protect the city from extremes in weather and prevent evocation and teleportation magic. It is rumored 
					that evil hearts cannot pass beyond them, though the city's bloody history suggests otherwise.
