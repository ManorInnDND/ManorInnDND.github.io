				Shithead - Pleasant Dreams
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				After casting Bane to encourage Margo's death you felt a rush 
				of excitement and inspiration. Last night you dreamt of her 
				choking in the dust, her stupid red hair tangled and broken
				like her body. You feel a strong disapproval bearing down 
				from somewhere above you. Looking up you Onnie and a 
				plump halfing woman frowning down, their faces taking up 
				the whole of the cavern's ceiling. Then a low chuckle dissolves
				their faces into a shadowy mask. A voice whispers 'free yourself'  
			</p>
			<h2>What this means</h2>
			<p class="Core">
				Your actions with Margo have shifted your alignement toward evil. 
				The god who provides your cleric spells (Tymora via Onnie proxy)
				is disappointed. You may lose your access to cleric spellcasting 
				abilities if you commit another 'evil' act. But... another entity is 
				offering you access to cleric spells, an evil entity. You can choose 
				to drop Tymora and embrace this dark unkown entity, or find another 
				god of known origin through prayer (we discuss gods and you pick one 
				that aligns with your character). <a href="mailto:earp1918@gmail.com"
