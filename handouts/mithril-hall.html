				Mithril Hall - Your Party's General Knowledge
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Below is general information about the greatest of the northern dwarf holds. If you have further questions you can ask about 
				a subject and one of you may know more with a successful roll (typically history roll)
			</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Mithril hall is a legendary dwarf hold located in the heart of Fourthpeak, the ever-smouldering southernmost moutain of the 
				spine of the world range. . 200 years ago nearly the entire citzenry of the hold was slain 
				by a shadow dragon, <span class="npc">Shimmergloom</span>. 150 years later the dragon was slain and the hold 
				has been slow to recover. (10,000 dwarves were slain, current population is 2,500). 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				The hold is ruled by the dragon-slayer <span class="npc">King Bruenor Battlehammer</span>, a warrior-king known for his 
				just and folksy demeanor and suspicion of magic. The vast halls and mazelike passages are seldmon busy except for the center
				of the city as the population is at 25% of the city's former population. 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				The dwarves are generally cagey, the destruction of their home a recent memory (for dwarves). They tend to distrust 
				unproven outsiders, especially dragonborn.

				<h2>
					General Info
				<hr>
				</h2>
				<h3>General Features</h3>
				The innumerable halls are vast, often dark, and often silent. 
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Vacant Chambers.</span> The city is only 
					at 25% of it's capacity. Many chambers are empty and several major forges are dormant. The deepest levels 
					have their tunnels collapsed until the city needs to expand again.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Monolithic Architecture</span> 
					Everything is stone and iron, even the chairs. Ceiling are high and doors are heavy. Things last.

				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Sound.</span>The wards dampen sound above a certain pitch, even the  busiest streets are 
					pleasingly muted.
				</p>
				<h3>Personages</h3>
				King Bruenor is the most famed, many dwarf elders and master smiths and high priets live here too.
				<h3>Locales</h3>
				Several of the more prominent places are listed below.
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">The Maze.</span>After entering Mithral Hall from the western entrance in Keeper's Dale, one was faced with a short corridor and then a complex network of twisting tunnels and side rooms. This section on the upper level was known as the Maze. It was a knotted web of tunnels filled with traps and dead ends. Its purpose was to slow down or stop any invaders. Invited guests were instructed to wait in the entry hall to be met by a guide, as attempting to navigate the maze without the requisite knowledge could be fatal.
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">The Undercity.</span>In the center of the mountain lay the Undercity, the main living quarters for the miners and permanent residents. What was already a large natural cave was carved out further by the town founders. The walls had ledges carved into them like a colosseum, with several small homes carved into each of the giant steps.[16] Although only inhabited by a few thousand in 1372 DR, this town had the capacity to house some 10,000 individuals.[25] In the middle of the chamber, at the lowest level, were the workshops and furnaces where the majority of the forging and labor took place. The glow of the forge lit and warmed the entire Undercity. Towering over the Undercity was a bridge allowing miners to navigate through the city rather than around it
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Garumn's Gorge.</span>
					Garumn's Gorge was a massive natural cavern within the east side of the mountain. Although unconfirmed, it was almost undoubtedly named after the Sixth King of Mithral Hall, Garumn Battlehammer. The 330m (1000ft) deep cave could only be crossed via a small bridge. This bridge led to the east entrance, and could be used as a great defensive tool.[22] The bridge was also blocked by a portcullis, which was operated from a room on the other side of Mithral Hall.[21] Down one side of the gorge, there was a waterfall known as Bruenor Falls. Bruenor Falls led to a small basin of water at the bottom of the gorge, which in turn trickled out through caves in the mountain into the River Surbrin.[14] During Shimmergloom's reign, the gorge was known as Shimmergloom's Run.[4] A cave at the bottom of the gorge lead to the deep mines east of the Undercity.[14]

				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Halls of Gathering.</span> 
					On the upper levels, on the east side of the complex, were the Halls of Gathering. These huge rooms were used as a meeting and greeting place for visitors and guests. Here the majority of Mithral Hall's occupants could meet (depending on the current population) and share pleasantries with any newcomers.[22]
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Hall of Dumathoin.</span>
					Named after the patron of shield dwarves and Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, Dumathoin, this room was used as storage for the vast wealth and treasures belonging to Mithral Hall and Clan Battlehammer. New visitors were shown this room on arrival after being seen through the Hall of Gathering.[22] Some of the treasures included masterwork weapons, armor, gems, and jewelry.[26]
