				Seven Moons - Ahm's Visit
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Suddenly the bearded face of Ahm, the author of the book you were lucky enough to taste the wisdom of appears in the passage ahead of you. 
				He emits a dim light which quickly brightens until it is just you and his floating head, which has increased in size to about 3' in diameter. He wears a simple black turban and 
				has the characteristic mocha tan skin of a desert dweller. His age is uncertain, though no more than 50, and his face is hard and 
				eagle-like in it's severity. Below the head, 
				where a body would be is just the hint of a spinal column, occaisonally wriggling and fading into nonexistance at about the 4th 
				vertebrae.
			</p>
			<p class="Core">
				Ahm grins revealing yellowed teeth, themselves emitting more light. "Seven Moons, honered devotee and twice-blessed immaculate. You are in a position to prove yourself worthy of the gifts I have bestowed on you." The head floats toward you, forhead first. Suddenly you feel an urge to consider 
				your recent dealings with your allies. You know Ahm is seeking access to your recent memories. What do you do? Share the memories? Resist and hide them? Something else?
