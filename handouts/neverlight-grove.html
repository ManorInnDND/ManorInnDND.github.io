				Neverlight Grove - Facts from Stool
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Below is the information gained from Stool during your journey toward Neverlight Grove.

				<h2>
					General Info
				<hr>
				</h2>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					Roughly 150 myconids and their spore servants live here. They are divided into 
					six circles, each ruled by a larger specimen called a circle leader; the largest
					specimens,called Sovereigns, govern the entire colony. 
				</p>
				<h3>Circles</h3>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Circle of Hunters.</span> Loobamub leads this circle. They are repsonsible for 
					collecting corpses from the fungal wilds and returning them to the circle of Sporers for convertion into 
					spore servants.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Circle of Builders.</span> Gasbide leads this circle which is charged with 
					shaping and cultivating the giant mushrooms which serve as gathering places for the myconids.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Circle of Growers.</span> Hebopbe leads this circle which ensures the soil
					in the pools at the center of the grove is kept fertile, as well as tending fruiting fungi growing in the 
					around the central portion of the grove.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Circle of Sporers.</span> Yrberop leads this circle responsible for 
					seeding new myconids and spore servants.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Circle of Explorers.</span> Rasharoo runs this circle who patrol and
					explore the caves surrounding the grove.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Inner Circle.</span> Brelup, Posbara, and Breberil, along with the two 
					sovereigns form the council for this circle which governs the colony.
				</p>
				<h3>Sovereigns</h3>
				Two soverigns manage the colony, sharing power and responsiblity.
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Phylo.</span> The elder of the two soverigns, Phylo is majestic and 
					philosphical.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Basidia.</span> Came to the grove shortly before Stool left. Basidia 
					arrived with a small nomadic colony of myconids and was invited to stay and rule alongside Pyhlo 
					for as long as it liked. Basidia's example inspired Stool to venture beyond the bounds of the grove
					to learn about the outside world.
				</p>
				<h3>Geography</h3>
				The grove lies at the intersection of several fungal corridors, in a large cavern. All surfaces of 
				the cavern are covered with fungi, including the ceiing.
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Underground Marsh.</span> Water trickles into the cavern from countless
					sources forming terraces, pools, and streams. This creates an undergound marsh ideal for the growth of
					fungi and the myconids.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Abundant Fungi.</span>Mushrooms, molds, and lichen grow in abundance in
					the grove creating a bizzare and beutiful tapestry of color.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Natural Silence.</span>Myconids do not speak, the only sounds in the grove
					are those of water, softened by the countelss absorbent surfaces.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Otherworldy Light.</span> Luminescen ichen grows across the cavern and 
					on many of the larger mushrooms, bathing the grove is soft hues of yellow, blue, and violet. Dim 
					light suffuses the entire grove, lending it a dreamlike quality.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">The Cycle.</span> Each cycle of a myconid "day" consists of working, 
					resting, and melding. Each of these periods takes 1/3 of the 24 hour cycle, after which the cycle repeats.
					Melding occurs as the myconid enters communual trance where the individual conciousness of the myconids
					merge to share their experiences and desires.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE_BODY_INDENT">
					<span class="metadata_start">Spore Servants.</span> Non-plant or fungal corpses can be sown with a 
					special spore that overtakes the corpse's deteriorating nervous system. After a period of colonization
					the body is able to move and respond to commands from myconids, but retains no memories of it's past life.
					Stool assures you the grove only uses these spores on corpses they gather from the lands surrounding the 
					grove.
