				Onnie - Boons of the Righteous
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Another dream suggesting contact with Mt. Celestia occured last night, as you 
				slept on the outskirts of The Labyrinth. The visiting angel had a warlike aspect
				and spoke in a stern paternal voice. As before the angels features are unclear, 
				the brightness of it's form obscuring them from your eyes. 
			</p>
			<p class="Core">
				"Onnie Ottilie. There is discord in heaven, with some of our number unwilling 
				to aid your realm against the terrible forces loosed upon it by foolish magic. I 
				am not among them, and offer to widen the conduit connecting you to this place, therby 
				expanding your capacity to return your home to a balanced, lawful state."
			</p>
			<p class="Core">
				The figure kneels and fills a golden chalice with liquid from a alabaster fountain, then extends the chalice, brimming with sparkling clear liquid.
				Like water but thinner, like vodka but odorless.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"Drink and the arteries of your divine bloodline shall be succored." <br>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="Core">
				You drink and dissolve into light.
			</p>
			
			<h2>What this means</h2>
