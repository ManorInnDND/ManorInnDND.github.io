			<h1>
				On Improving the Game Experience
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Below are the strategies I will be implementing in our game. I 
				believe they will improve your experience of the game. These strategies 
				are taken from The Angry GM blog, specifically his <a href="https://theangrygm.com/true-game-mastery/">
					True Game Mastery</a> series of articles. 
			</p>
			<h3>TL;DR</h3>
			<p class="Core">
				Some fundamentals of how you and I interact are being redefined. The biggest is that 
				I am now 'owning' all of the events that happen in the game. You tell me what your 
				character intends to do and I describe what happens when they attempt to do it. This 
				is different than our looser 'tell me what you do and I'll jump in if it goes to far'. The 
				structure of narration is changing too, I will only be stating facts - nothing about what 
				your character feels or thinks. Related to this is the new handling of skills like 
				Insight and Perception. I'll tell you if your character knows something based on their 
				abilities instead of you asking if you can try to remember or intuit someting. Along with this 
				the habit of using game mechanics when describing actions is also being reduced as much as possible.
				I'm not expecting you to memorize this stuff or 
				even read it - I'll be explaining and nudging as we play - but it's here if you want to know what 
				I am trying to do, and all of it is described in detail on the Angry GM blog mentioned above.
			</p>
			<h3>Ownership</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Concept.</span> Players care more about games that 
				have real stakes, at least in the long run. To make the stakes in real in D&D the DM describes the 
				world and adjudicates the actions the players declare. 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Implementation.</span> It's on me to describe everything that happens. When you describe what 
				your character does I will be interpreting what you say as what your character <i>intends to do</i>. I
				will confirm with you that what I think you mean is what you mean and then describe the outcome 
				of your intention to act. 
			</p>
			<h3>How to Act</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Concept.</span> For a player to influence the game world they need to 
				declare an intention that is actionable. Actionable intentions are many, and there are many non-actionable 
				declarations too. The game world will only respond to actionable intentions. It is the 
				DMs job to describe everything the character perceives, and only what they perceive. It is 
				the players job to decide what do with their character's perception. Also, allowing players to 
				use game mechanic terms in their actions contrains imagination and limits immersion. 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Implementation.</span> When describing what your character intends to 
				do it's got to be actionable. Actionable stuff is something that acts on something else in the game 
				world. 'I drawn my broadsword as I charge the baron.' is an action.
				'I think the baron is ugly.' is not an action, it is happening inside your character's head. 
				Also the mechanics of the game should not be part of your action declarations, instead of 'I enter 
				the room and perception for interesting stuff.' Try 'I enter the room and approach the chest, examining 
				the floor and chest for traps on the way.'
			</p>
			<h3>Skills and Actions</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Thinking & Recall.</span> Things your character would know 
				I will tell you when setting a scene - you will not need to ask if you remember something. For 
				example, suppose a monster requires a religion check to know more about. Instead of asking for a 
				religion roll I will ask for a die roll in secret or maybe just use the passive number. If you 
				pass you get the additional info when encountering the thing the roll was related to:
				<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
					You see a filthy humanoid in ragged ceremonial robes with a distended belly, its 
					skeletal head gapes hungrily beneath a square-shaped cap. Because
					of his time in the Nag'ru priesthood, Mad Dog recogonizes it as a 
					mumm-ratha, an undead guardian of religious texts - texts that 
					are often concealed within the body of the guardian.
				</p>
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Spotting & Searching.</span> Many of these kinds of 
				actions happen automatically or without action, just like recall and thinking stuff.
				You either make the perception check 
				(in secret) or not. If you make it you get a clue and it is up to you to act on it. Suppose 
				for example an arrow trap just ahead. The trap has a DC 15 to perceive. Anyone in 
				the party who has a Passive Perception of 15+ would hear this description:
				<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
					The passage turns abruptly to the right, just where it turns Mad Dog notices 
					the wall on the left has been badly scratched.
				</p>
				And a 20+ would hear this:
				<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
					The passage turns abruptly to the right, just where it turns Mad Dog notices 
					the wall on the left has been badly scratched, and several of the floor tiles 
					are slightly raised.
				</p>
				And a 14- would hear this:
				<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
					The passage turns abruptly to the right. 
				</p>
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Sneaking & Skulking.</span> Following from needing 
				to describe your intent without game mechanic terms, hiding requires more than 
				'I try to hide in the room.' Where? How? 'I hide behind the tapestry on my tip toes.'
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Speaking and Schmoozing.</span> However you describe 
				your words, that's just what you sound like in your head. Your character's skills 
				determine your eloquence or lack therof. What you say is important so far as it 
				relates to relevance, emotions appealed to, and leverage used. But passion and poetry
				will not change the DC. Still thats not to discourage them. 
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Feeling and Sensing.</span> This one is tough, since I 
				am not going to say 'Mad Dog thinks the baker is lying about the pie.' since that is telling you what 
				your character thinks.  Instead I am going to provide clues similiar to spotting traps. 
				'I don't know nutthin about no stinkin pie says the baker, glancing at the storeroom door as he does.'
			</p>
			<h3>The Pricipal Character</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Concept.</span> Good pacing makes for good feeling gameplay. When the DM hands off 
				control of the pacing it should be clear who needs to take over and describe their intent.
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Implementation.</span> No more asking 'What do you all do?' Instead I will be asking whoever's 
				character is the most appropriate in a given situation what their character intends to do. Sometimes initiative order will 
				determine this, other times it's whoever is closest to the source of the thing being narrated.
			</p>
			<h3>The Action Queue</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Concept.</span> Managing multiple character actions requires knowing each character's intention 
				before resolving any action. Queuing up actions by shifting the prinicpal character until all players have declared 
				intentions to act allows for more realistic resolution of those actions.
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter-CORE_BODY_INDENT">
				<span class="metadata_start">Implementation.</span> I'll ask everyone what they do after setting a scene. Once everyone is accounted 
				for I will begin resolving actions in order that they would take to resolve in game time-ish. Consider the following:
				<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
					The room is 40' square with natural stone walls, no windows. A low circular wall against the far 
					side of the room encircles a pool of water, above which is a shimmering man sized oval of many 
					colors - a portal! It is set in the wall above the pool. A stone door is set on the right wall.
				</p>
				With an action queue approach:
				<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
					Mad Dag is standing at the doorway, his comrades behind. What does Mad Dog do Sarah? "I rush to the pond to spit out the sunflower 
					seeds I have been chewing." "Mad Dog enters the room, eyes on the pond" Erin, Fluffy of Rabbiton sees Mad Dog enter and is right behind him at the entry door, what does 
					FLuffy do?" "I rush after Mad Dog and grab his cloak trying to stop him." "Fluffly enters the room right behind Mad Dog. Luke, Ranger Rick was behind Fluffy, what 
					does he do?" "He approaches the door to the right to inspect it." No one else is playing so that's all the actions queued up, now what happens first... Fluffy is fast
					and was right behind Mad Dog so "Fluffy grabs Mad Dog's cloak and asks him to stop. What does Mad Dog do?" "I push away and keep heading for the fountain." "Erin, Fluffy 
					feels Mad Dog attempting to free himself from their paws, what does Fluffy do?" "I let go and stand there watching." "Mad Dog pushes Fluffy away and rushes to the 
					pond, the pond is clear and still. A mosaic of some kind on it's bottom. Mad Dog reaches the edge of the pool with seeds in mouth, what does he do Sarah?" This gives 
					Sarah a chance to ask about the Mosaic. "I spit out all the seeds."
				</p>
				Not doing an action queue would have had Mad Dog already spitting into the pond and Fluffy would 
				not have been able to attempt to dissuade him. Although this method is slower than what we have been doing, 
				it does increase the realism and I think it will improve the pacing of our games.
