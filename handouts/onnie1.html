				Onnie - Prayers to Tymora
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Last night you dreamt of a wonderfully good and ordered place, with 
				lofty cloud-obscured mountains of cosmic magnitude. Brisk clean
				air wafts past, gently suggesting a presence. Turning from the 
				range of mountains you see a lumnious angelic being, tall, handsome, 
				and some. The being's face is obscure, as even your eyes are wearied 
				by the refulgent halo emitted by this angel. She speaks, her voice 
				hard and clear, and oddly materinal.  
			</p>
			<p class="Core">
				"Mount Celestia welcome a daughter home today, Onnie Ottilie."
				She pauses and turns towards the mountains behind you, before 
				continuing.
			</p>
