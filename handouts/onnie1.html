				Onnie - Prayers of an Aasimar
			</h1>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Last night you prayed for assistance from your ancestors before drifiting 
				off to sleep. You dreamt of a wonderfully good and ordered place, with 
				lofty cloud-obscured mountains of cosmic magnitude. Soft steps on 
				the snow approach, gently suggesting a presence. Turning from the 
				range of mountains you see a lumnious angelic being, tall and vaguely
				feminine. The being's face is obscure, even your Aasimarian eyes are wearied 
				by the refulgent halo above it. She speaks, her voice 
				hard and clear, and... maternal?
			</p>
			<p class="Core">
				"Mount Celestia welcome a daughter home today, Onnie Ottilie."
			</p>
			<p class="Core">
				She pauses, turning towards the mountains behind you, before 
				continuing. When you wake you try to recall all that she said, a few things 
				stand out clearly.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"We are already acting against the Abyssal agents, Onnie, consider
				what you are and what you are doing..." <br>
				"In some time you will come to a place where traitors of my kind 
				were long ago imprisoned. Take what you need from them and leave 
				quickly, they deserve neither pity nor freedom."<br>
				"Our time together ends, you are needed on Faerun. Remain the light in the 
				dark places, where all other lights go out." <br>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="Core">
				Awake in the Tiny Hut, with the immensity of the Underdark looming 
				down you feel something soft in your left hand hand, which 
				turns out to be a magnificent downy feather about a foot long.
			</p>
			
			<h2>What this means</h2>
			<p class="Core">
				You are the help from Mount Celestia, stopping the demons is your 
				destiny! So long as you possess the angel feather you gain the following
				racial abilities:
				<ul>
					<li>As a bonus action you grant yourself or an ally you can see advantage on any roll against a fiend. This ability can be used once per short rest.</li> 
					<li>As an action you <strong>expend the angel feather</strong> to restore yourself or an ally you can see to full hit points. The ally or yourself 
						may have been dead for up to ten days. This does not resore spent spell slots or class abilites.</li>
				</ul>
