				Earlier today you interrogated the drow wizard about about Menzoberranzan before scalping him. This evening 
				while meditating his face appears to as it did 
			</p>
			<h2>What this means</h2>
			<p class="Core">
				The voice wants you to force the dragonborn that Onnie hired to make her lance to eat it. Disobeying or delaying more than a day may be 
				unpleasant. You are hearing the voice of a sage who calls himself Ahm, and he has promised to lead you to your ancestral homeland (you being
				Seven-Moons).This is a form of madness, it can be cured like Tyler was or through magic, though you currently identify as Seven-Moons and don't
				know you are mad. If you are presented with information suggesting you are insanse can remake your wisdom save one time, DC 20. If you fail you 
				remain Seven-Moons indefinitely, though you may attempt to act as though you think you are Seven-Stars if you wish.
