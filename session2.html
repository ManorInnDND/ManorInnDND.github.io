        <p class="Chapter_CHAPTER-TITLE">Session 2 Synopsis</p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">The host arrived and asked you all to play a guessing game. He was a middle-aged human with a large mustache and a red face and his likeness appeared on the staues in the courtyard, leading you to believe he was Quincy. However he appears to be some kind of monster who inhabited Quincy's body! You learned all this when he ambushed your group with animated chairs and murdered Brunor. After you smashed the chairs and slew the insane serving maid the head of a demon appeared in the fireplace and &quot;ate&quot; Brunor's soul. It then swore to eat your souls as well before vanishing in the flames. </p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">Your group left the dining area and began to to explore the mansion, except for REW RA who slept soundly on the dining table. Soon you ran into Torgo again, who was being bullied by a scrawny youth with a pimply face in a large red-cowled robe. You slew the youth with a single arrow as he turned to attack you and asked Torgo about what was going on. Torgo took a long time to explain but the gist was that:</p>
        <ui > <li>A group calling itself the &quot;Red Listens&quot;, wearing red robes believe that an army of extra-planar creatures will dominate this world soon.   </li>     
          <li>10 days ago the leaders of the group were instructed to come to the mansion to free one said extra-planar creatures</li>
          <li>The cultists came and slew everyone in the mansion     </li>
          <li> In the cellar a coffin was opened by the group and the entity within in possessed the body of the manison's owner.</li>
        <li> This owner, who Torgo called &quot;The Master&quot;, then altered the 4 chief members of the Red Listens in some way to make them more powerful.</li>
        <li> One was made strong (Torgo's Uncle), another was made small, the third vanished when he slept and now walks in dreams, and the fourth died during the process. </li>       
        <li> When the third died one of the guests at the mansions before the attack was found hiding in the green house and was changed &quot;into a bush er--- planted&quot;.</li>                 
        <li>Some &quot;ancient things&quot; (valuables) are upstairs  </li></ui>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">Torgo wants to leave and is hiding outside among the hedges in the courtyard for now.</p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">After Galifraen aquired some archaic but functional chainmail you traveled upstairs in search of valuables. Passing by an enchanted suit of armor that strikes out with it's halbered at anyone who gets close, you slew 2 sleeping cultists and tricked a third, and rather vain cultist who you then killed. On him you found some strange purple powder which induces a deep sleep on anyone who comes into contact with it. Later you found a shit-covered lavatory, and looked out over a large balcony to discover that the world outside was somehow cut-off by a great amber-red cloud of fog. Attempting to pass through the fog with Horace the owl proved unfruitful - some kind of spacial distortion prevent travel much beyond 80' of the mansion roof, and probably halts travel beyond or to the gate. You also found a trunk in a room which held some frightened creature but you decided not to attempt to open the chest by force and instead locked it.</p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">Back inside you found two more cultists looking for a hand like object in a room of curios, along with a brute of a man who stood by silently. One of you passes himself off as a cultist again and stabbed the large man, but was brutally repaid with a blow which knocked him unconcious. A unpleasant fight ensued but your group emerged victorious, though wounded.</p>
