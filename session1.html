            You all received an unusual letter in the mail which read:<br>
            <i>Dear friend,
                I, Jerfort Qunicy Wutherton III, cordially invite you to attend supper at my country home in Mistledale. You may have heard of me from my exploits abroad. I am enclosing 10 sovereigns in the hope that you will find them sufficient cause to attend the meeting I have planned. Arrangments have been made at the White Hart Inn in Ashabenford for your reception should you arrive early.
                Please do come, I am not a spiritual man but have had strange dreams of late, and believe our fates are somehow intertwined. I feel I somehow owe you a debt, and hope meeting with you personally will jog my memory... The innkeep at the White Stag will have instructions for you once you arrive.
                Your friend,
                Quincy
                </i>
            </p>

            You decided to head to The White Stag, and met several other adventurers who received similiar letters, after some discussion you decided to travel with these adventurers
            to the Manor and asked around the tavern for information on Quincy. You learned that he was well respected as a explorers and collector of exotic relics. A while later rustic 
            coach arrived (more of a straw wagon) and took you out of town on a 2-hour journey along the forest's edge. At some point on the ride a wolf print was found, as well as some
            light source among the trees. Your driver was friendly, though he knew little of Quincy.
        </p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
            Arriving at the gates of the mansion you observed a roughly 200-year-old building, fit for a noble. You proceeded into the courtyard and noted several statues
            with plaques depicting Quincy in various heroic poses in exotic lands. Knocking at the front door you met Torgo, the awkward butler of the estate. Torgo led you
            into the dining room where you met another guest who called himself "Brunor". Torgo poured drinks while Brunor asked you about yourselves, and you learned that Brunor
            had received a letter similiar to yours and that he is a grain merchant. Rew ate some of the bread and fell into a deep sleep while the rest of you spoke with each other
            and waited for the host to arrive.
