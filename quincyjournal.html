        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
Most of the journal is about Quincy's trouble with finding good help and complaints about an aging body. There are a few passages however that are interesting:<br></p>
            <p class="quote" style=text-indent:0px> ...I forgot the tune for the organ again and decided to earmark the page though guests aren’t as impressed when I have to go grab the book in the middle of dinner...<br>
            ...Murdol has begun preparing my meals per my new regimen, the ingredients cost a fortune being magical so I’ll have him hide them in unassuming containers to keep my less trustworthy help put of trouble....</p>
            <p class="quote" style=text-indent:0px>...My dreams have been most unpleasant of late, and all of my guests are suffering as well. Most have left. I dread going into the cellar though I am certain my latest purchase is to blame. I’ve not been bested by any tomb’s curse yet, and I won’t be now. I must have the coffin thoroughly disenchanted and then open the damn thing...</p>
			<p class="quote" style=text-indent:0px>...I must find more information about the tomb from which the coffin came. I must visit Calimshan soon and see the tomb for myself. Unusual but Jeerko can surely be persuaded with some coin...</p>
            <p class="quote" style=text-indent:0px>...I feel more apathetic about the coffin, perhaps I will leave it closes, the one foreign treasure I permit to remain inviolate...</p>
