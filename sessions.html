						Session 10: Gracklstugh 1
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						<span class="figure">

							Gracklstugh
						</span>As the party draws closer to <span class="location">Gracklstugh</span> two monstrous mermen rise out of the water
						and attack the boat, attempting to capsize it. The heroic efforts of <span class="pc">Francis</span> are able
						to stabilize the boat and <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> manages to leap onto one of the brutes and deal
						a killing blow, causing the other to flee. After this brief upset the group approaches one of the shabbier 
						docks of Gracklstugh.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The first impressions of the city are unfavorable, though the sanctuary it offers from the desolate blackness of the
						surrounding Underdark lends it some charm. The city is a bleak expanse of monolithic stone buildings, most of which
						are dedicated to industry. The city is bustling, mostly with duergar, but many other Underdark races are present as 
						well mostly drow and orcs. There is also a large community of marginalized derro. Outsiders are restricted from 
						traveling beyond the gated <span class="location">Darklake District</span> of the city. 
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						<span class="npc">Hemeth</span> shows the party to the city's only inn that accepts outsiders as guests, <span class="location">
						The Gholbrorn's Lair</span>. The "Lair" is an complex of damp passages under the cities streets and apparently floods in 
						spring. Hemeth pays for the groups room and board for one week and offers to act as trader in the 
						the the citie's trading plaza, known as the <span class="location">Blade Bazaar</span>. After an unusual meal the group 
						retires to their rooms, some scrambling to obtain a private room for the night.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The following morning the group ventures out of their rooms and has another strange meal, they overhear some nearby
						patrons complaining about the increasingly dangerous trade routes and others complaining about the price of goods.
						Galifraen approaches one of the patrons and offers to sell the Kua-Toan boat the group stole but the trader baulks,
						citing the danger of sea trade. Shortly after Hemeth enters and the group leaves to trade.					
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The Blade Bazaar offers a complete catalog of mundane goods amongst the permanent stalls of it's many vendors. 
						While here the group manages to sell their boat for 700 gp, and uses the proceeds to outfit themselves more
						appropriately. Apart of arms and armor several memebers of the group opt for more opulent clothing, with 
						<span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> purchasing a fine cloak and brooch.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT"></p>					
						Much of the day is spent trading, and while negotiating the purchase of a map of the Underdark, 
						a beserk, two-headed, grey-skinned giant crashes into the bazaar
						and begins attacking everything around it. Despite its size and strength the party is able to slay the mad giant,
						although <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> suffers a haymaker to the face, knocking him unconcious. In the aftermath
						several duergar guards confer and another stone giant, named <span class="npc">Dorhun</span> arrives and is distraught 
						at his associates death. After a brief exchange with the party he takes offense at a remark of <span class="pc">Shithead</span>'s
						and leaves carrying the slain giant. The duergar guards converge on the group and escort them to a nearby official building
						for their statements. Seven-Stars also manages to find some prime fishguts and to dump them on Galifraen but is disappointed
						that this fails to turn Galifraen into cool Galifraen.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The building the group is taken to is an impressive stalagmite-bastion overlooking the Darklake. They are deposited into
						a spartan office before an official duergar named <span class="npc">Errde Blackskull</span> arrives and asks them about
						what happened. The group explains that the giant attacked unprovoked and slew a duergar right in front of them before they 
						engaged with it. Errde accepts this, then asks the characters to help her. She suspects a conspiracy among the leaders of the 
						derro, known as the "Council of Savants", that may involve some of the deurgar clan leaders (lairds) as well. A derro known as
						<span class="pc">Droki</span> is known to have illicit dealings with the savants but he has avoided capture or even pursuit 
						from her guards. She hopes that the adventures might have better luck as outsiders in tailing Droki. All she knows is that he lives
						in the <span class="location">West Cleft District</span> and frequents the Blade Bazaar. She believes that the conspiracy
						is somehow corrupting the minds of many of the duergar in the city and will reward evidence of corruption with gear from the
						duergar military's armory. She concludes by darkly mentioning that the adventurers should not attempt to leave the city without
						attending to Droki, implying that her "offer" is more of an ultimatum. Finally she gives each member of the party iron insignia
						bearing the mark of the Stone Gaurds (the military elite of Gracklstugh), which she says will grant them passage beyond the 
						Darklake District.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The group decides to rest before heading to the West Cleft District and searching for Droki. During the evening several of them
						pass disguting black balls of tar-like flem and decide to purchase masks in the morning. While the rest of the group retires
						Shithead sets his heart on an orcish woman in the inn's common area but is attacked by a duergar slaver and decides to flee
						to the saftey of his room. 
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The following morning <span class="npc">Sareth</span> is too sick to leave bed, and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> demonstrates
						her deities favor by healing him of his coughing though the boils on his face continue to spread. The group travels to the 
						Blaze Bazaar and heads to area dominated by derro traders and buyers. Although coldy received the party asks about hiring 
						Droki through a contact named <span class="npc">Ylsa</span>, but when asked about Droki Ylsa claims ignorance, even when 
						presented with evidence that she does indeed know him. Disappointed in the lack of help, the group decides to head to 
						the West Cleft District and look for Droki there and as they leave a wretched derro begs Shithead for "summin ta' eat".
						It's request granted, the derro mutters that Droki wears a "floppy hat", before scurrying away into the bazaar.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Resuming their walk towards the West Cleft District, the group passes through one of the gates that border the Darklake District,
						and learn from the guards that Droki is a devious bastard. One of the guards also mentions abandoned guard towers that look into 
						the the West Cleft District and might provide a good vantage for watching the derro that come and go.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Beyond the gate of the Darklake the party find themselves in an even more bleak part of Gracklstugh, with even more forges and
						fumes than the Darklake District. They now make their way towards <span class="location">Laduguer's Furrow</span>, a great chasm
						in which many of the duergar live, the edges of which make up the east and west cleft districts.
					</p>
				</section>

					<h3>
						Session 9: Leemoogoogoon
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The frog-folk that approached last session indeed turn out to be friendly! They are lead by <span class="npc">Plooploopeen</span>,
						a frog-folk archpriest of a deity he refers to as "The Sea Mother". A slightly confused <span class="npc">Saren</span> 
						translates for group as Ploop explains to the group about his troubled village. Apparently his daughter has had
						visions which inspired her to oppose her father with the worship of a deity known as "The Deep Father". Ploop
						asked the group to accompany him back to the village as false prisoners, which he would offer to his daughter as
						sacrifices. Then he would attempt to kill her and her followers, with the help of the party. The group decided
						to accept in exchange for a guided passage across the <span class="location">Darklake</span> and towards 
						<span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>. 
					</p>	
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Following the priest and his guards, the group is led into a vast cavern whose cheif feature is an
						immense lake. After trekking out onto an isthmus cutting across the lake and traveling for about an 
						hour the group finally arrives at the entrance to <span class="location">Sloobludop</span>. 
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> moves towards the lake's edge to fish but is dissuaded by the frog-folk
						who warn he may get pulled in.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The village is built across a portion of the isthmus and is protected by land with walls composed
						of tangled netting and hooks. Ploop escorts the party to his faction's area in the squalid village,
						with an unpleasant stature of a humanoid female carved of wood with a genuine crawfish head and
						claws strapped to it's figure with fishgut. Piled about its base are "offerings" mostly rotting 
						marine life. Inside his hut Ploop explains that he is going to parley with his daughter and offer
						you as sacrifices - he expects to return shortly. A heap of wealth temps <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						to theivery but the rope leashing him to the rest of the party stays his paws. Ploop returns with the 
						good news - you are to be sacrified!
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Ploop and the group are escorted under guard to the "Altar of the Deep Father" where the opposing 
						priest is preparing for the sacrifice. 
						<span class="figure">
							<img src="Introduction2-web-resources/images/sloobludop/Altar.png" >
							Altar of the Deep Father
						</span>
						Three unconscious captives were  dragged in front of the altar and roused. A human, a duergar,
						and a halfing - or possibly goblin. Then the arhcpriestess orders her guards to prod the party towards
						these captives, she then utters a short prayer to the Deep Father.						
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Just before she signals for the sacrifice to begin, her father attacks her with his scepter - stunning her
						with the blow and signaling the party to strike! A few seconds of chaotic battle ensue before the priestess
						is slain with a blow to the head. Unfortunately the gore from her death christens the altar evoking an ominous
						roiling in the water of the lake. A terrible foe then bursts from the depths - a tentacle armed monstrosity with
						two <a href="importantnpcs.html#big_nasties">baboon</a> -like heads lumbers towards the village causing most of 
						the surviving frog-folk to panic, pray, or flee.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Witnessing such a horror manifested overcomes some of the adventures. Seven-Stars begins miming as though he were
						eating food. Shithead falls unconcious <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> takes the chance splattering of fishgut across his eyes as an
						act of providence, becoming much endeared to said fishguts. Feeling confident Galifraen aims a shot at the 
						massive creature hulking toward the village but somehow misses. This decides most of the party is a clear indication
						that it is time to flee. The frog-folk are too scattered and panicked to offer any resistance to the group stealing
						a large Kuo-Toan keelboat. The three captives who were to be sacrificed also manage to join the group although 
						Seven-Stars is nearly left behind to perish. As the group rows the alien craft away from the carnage a inadvertant
						tentacle lash from Leemoogoogoon knocks <span class="npc">Stool</span> overboard - but it is promptly rescued.
						Tragically the group realizes too that the <span class="pc">Moa</span> vanished during the conflict, and likely died
						in the frog-folk village.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Shortly after their escape the party gets aquainted with their new companions. <span class="pc">Francis</span> is
						a young adult human male with a warriors background - though he says little about himself, <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						is an ugly halfing, or plain-looking goblin, and <span class="npc">Helmeth</span> is a severe duergar with shifty
						eyes. After a brief discussion the group decides to travel to Gracklstugh, where they hope to finally aquire some 
						equipment worth of their talents.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Crossing the Darklake
					</h4>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						With Gracklstugh as a destination the group starts rowing with gusto, breaking themselves into three 
						shifts of 2 rowers + a navigator. This means the oars are operated continously and cuts the journey
						of 10 days down to just 3! The group soon learns that the less time spent on the water, the better...
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Only a few hours into the first day a levitating 70 lb brain featuring a beak the size of an arm
						and stinging tenctacles decends silently down onto the boat and attempts to make a meal of Galifraen. 
						Failing in this the brain goes for Zodius and pulls him up and into the darkness above the sailing
						craft. Galifraen harpoons the beast with a rope-tethered crossbow bolt while most of the party 
						is forced to watch - having no way to attack a creature so far away. Zodious teleports away
						and Galifraen sends another bolt into the creature - killing it. Francis steers the vessel
						under the gently falling corpse and a bounty of meat is secured. <span class="pc">Oni</span>
						assures everyone that she can purify fouled food and drink and so the group has enough to 
						sustain them for the journey!
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The next two days are fraught with danger, with the first shift of rowers suffering the most. Several
						sentient manta ray attack the hull of the boat but give up a short time later. A voice calls out 
						for help while some of the taller members of the party knock their heads against a low overhang - Helmeth
						believes the voice to be that of one of the hags local to the Darklake area. A swarm of leathery mosquito
						like monsters buzz angrily about the parties heads during a rockfall - but soon pass on to a new home. 
						Perhaps most notably, four frog-folk happen within sight of the party and are pursued and subjected to 
						a cruel confiscation of most of their meagre equipment. Galifraen is noted for leaping onto the frog-folk's
						ship despite a spear hitting him mid-leap! Also notably is Shithead's conduct during the raid during which
						she recovered a muscle shell from among the bowels of one of the Kua-Toa - all of whom she "searched". Finally,
						the party wrestled with a gangly aquatic giant intent on draggin the boat into a whirlpool. When this failed 
						the giant attempted to board the boat by climbing up one side. Zodious was quite vocal about his plans to
						catapult the giant 50 feet into the air by leaping to one side of the boat but failed to convince his
						fellow adventurers. but was flung off by a powerful feat of strength by Francis. The effects of eating 
						nothing but brains for the last two days appear to have begun taking a toll on the groups mental state
						about this time as well as most of the party seemed more confused and boisterous than typical.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Shorly after the ordeal with the troll the party enters another of the great chambers of the Darklake area,
						and can dimly make out an orange smoldering light in the distance. Gracklstugh is within sight! Only an hour
						or so remains before they reach the city of the duergar! During this last stretch of rowing Galifraen
						has an abrupt change of heart regarding the fishguts, finding them suddenly abhorrent. He casts them into the water
						before washing his face, then seeks solitude in the hold of the boat. Jeering from Shithead makes this impossible
						and Galifraen decides instead to sulk at the edge of the boat, overcast by the twinkling smokey light of your next
						destination... Gracklstugh.

					<h3>
						Session 8: Narrow 'Scapes and Awed Frogs
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Whilst gathering the glowing crystals after <span class="npc">Grazzilax</span>'s departure, the group is 
						interrupted by several of their Drow pursuers. Chasing the drow down a passage, the party is at first
						triumphant, felling 3 of their 4 pursuers. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> even manages to collect 
						a scalp during the chase. Unfortunately the battle turns when the last surviving drow regroups with
						your former warden<a href="importantnpcs.html#jailers"> <span class="npc">Ilvara</span></a>!
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Ilvara's ire is manifested in a swarm of infuriated maggot-wasps which mercilessly sting several of the 
						heroes, some to the point of unconciousness. <span class="pc">Moa</span> addresses the swarm with
						a lesson on good, evil, and agency - speculating that, as maggots, they posses bodies symbolic
						of metamorphosis, and that their actions now will doubtless determine the shape of their mature form. 
						This slightly calms the swarm so that they do not attack Moa, and do not impede movement. Moa uses
						this opportunity to drag the unconcious Galifraen out of the swarm. 
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> ensures Galifraen's immediate recovery with a portentious certainty
						that Galifraen will 'roll a 20 on his next death saving throw'. <span class="pc">Oni</span>	moves
						to attack Ilvara but, hearing god suggest she flee, decides to run instead. The rest of the group 
						decide to flee as well and a long chase through the underdark ensues.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						For 4 minutes the party runs like mad. Jagged stones, exploding mushrooms, steep ascents, giant flea migrations, 
						wasp-maggots bites, poisonous spores and a slippery streambed confound a clean escape. During the 5th minute
						several members of the group must pause for breath, and are relieved to find they have escaped their pursuers.
						Taking stock they learn that <span class="npc">Prince Derendil</span> and <span class="npc">Eldeth</span> 
						were lost during the flight. <span class="npc">Jorlan</span>, the drow guard who helped you escape, was among
						your pursuers, and cut Eldeth down.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After a brief march to a safer locale, the party rests, and afterward decides to head to continue on to the 
						Kua-Toan village of <span class="location">Sloobludop</span>. The group plans to enter the village with 
						<span class="npc">Sareth</span> as a drow seeking passage, accompanied by Moa in the form of some undeground
						animal. However the group must still travel 2 days to reach the village and so they set out once more.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Their journey is impeded by a maze of webs, and also by a pair of Gricks which ambush the party. The gricks are 
						easily dispatched, though the moral justification for slaying them remains controvesal. Zodius firebolts a path
						through the webs and the group camps once more before making the final trek into Sloobludop.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The group revises their plan, and decides to use the glowing stones they found, as well as some spore-caviar
						as offerings to the Kuo-Toans, in exchange for a guided passage accross the darklakes. An hour outside of town
						the group is threatened by several frog-folk who wish to sacrifice the adventurers to their 'Deep Father' deity.
						Oni attempts to awe the leader of the frogs with some magic and cool eyes but the effect is diminished by her 
						struggle with some netting over her head. The frog men attack, their leader felling Oni, and later <span class="pc">Everin</span>
						until Oni is healed at which point she rises up and smites the leader with an awesome blow which sends the whole
						group of frogs hopping into the darkness. Just as the party regroups and plans to rest another knot of Kua-Toa 
						approach, this time peacably and eager confer. What will come of this meeting of amphibian and adventurer?
					</p>

					<h3>
						Session 7: Gracious Grazzilax
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After fleeing into the labryrinthine tunnels south of their former prison,<span class="location">Velkynevelve</span>,
						the group takes a moment to decide on a course of travel. A brief discussion determines that the drow <span class="npc">
						Sareth</span> is the only being with sufficient knowledge of the underdark to navigate without a map. The closest
						areas know to the drow are described:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Darklakes (7 days) - A large region of the underdark characterized by numerous underground lakes linked by 
							submerged tunnels and waterways. Traveling here is faster than on foot, but requires a boat.</li>
						<li>Menzoberranzan (26 days) - Most powerful of the drow cities, going here would certainly result in recapture</li>
						<li>Gracklstugh (20 days) - Stronghold of duergar and derro, a dangerous place but secure from drow attack, shortest route
							lies across the darklakes </li>
						<li>Neverlight Grove (24 days) - Home of Stool, a cavern of friendly sentient fungi</li>
						<li>Sloobludop (8 days) - Village of frog-men, attitude toward outsiders varies</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						It is decided that the immediate destination be <span class="location">Sloobludop</span> as the drow and the frog-men
						are not generally on good terms and a ship for crossing the darklakes should be accessible. Sareth warns the group that
						the frog-men (or Kuo-Toa in their own tongue) are as likely to be friendly as they are to be hostile, depending on the 
						mood of the prevailing high preist. The group also learns that the village is comprised of about 500 Kuo-Toans and that
						<span class="npc">Shushaar</span>, one of the the unfortunate prisoners who did not escape with you, mentioned that 
						the priesthood in the village was divided. After aquiring a boat the group plans to cross a portion of the darklakes
						aiming for <span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						With a clear destination the group resumes their journey, having left their prison without provisions the group must
						forage for food and water, which proves challenging in the alien undeground world. Without the familiar cycles of 
						night and day it is challenging to track time, and for now it is marked by the frequency of the group's need to rest.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The first "day" of travel proves very unpleasant for <span class="npc">Sareth</span>,<span class="npc">Eldeth</span>, <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>, and 
						<span class="pc">Everin</span>. Maddening voices subvert and malign the traveler's psyche during this day and the aforementioned
						adventurures succumb to the lunatic whispers of the tunnel. Eldeth fled in a panic while Sareth crumpled into a histeric ball 
						on the stone floor. Galifraen stared into the space in front of his eye and Everin begin attacking everyone around him.
						Fortunately <span class="pc">Moa</span> determined that these afflictions would only persist for minutes, and those who had danced with madness
						soon recovered their wits. When asked if such unpleasantness was common in the underdark Sareth responded in the negative.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After an unpleasant rest in a damp chamber the group traveled another day, and found water and food for all.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The next day is equally bleak with the added unpleasantness of an inadequate supply of food and water. While encamped the
						group encountered a pair of Kuo-Toan traders who offered an assortment of trinkets but were ultimately left without exchanging goods.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The fourth period of travel is uneventful, but hunger and thirst threaten to overwhelm the travelers. Several are quite exhausted 
						and are having trouble keeping pace. Near their campsite Everin and <span class="pc">Oni</span> spot a sinister fungi protruding 
						from the ceiling.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The fifth period of travel is dreadful at first, but late in the march a chamber spotted with growths of luminous 
						quartz is discovered, and in it a generous squid-headed creature. The creatue calls itself <span class="npc">Grazzilax</span>
						and offers the party aid in exchange for some "new data". Galifraen satifies the creature with a lecture on the sublties of 
						high elf blood relations. Grazzilax vanishes into the air, then reappears with water and food aplenty. He warns the group that
						the crystals in the chamber are explosive, a solid blow being sufficient to shatter them and release a flash of bright light.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Their growing thirst and hunger satisfied, and Sloobludop only 3 rest-cycles away, the groups fortunes seems brighter, especially
						under the warm glow of the quartz... 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session1">
					<h3>
						Session 6: Prisonbreak!
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You awaken in a daze on cold stone floor of a slave pen deep underground. All of the
						group is present, as well as 10 other captives. All your possessions, except your
						clothes, have been taken. <span class="pc">Everin</span> speaks  undercommon and enables
						the rest of the group to converse with <a href="importantnpcs.html#session1Prisoners">the other prisoners</a> ,
						the most talkataive of which is <span class="npc">Jimjar</span>. The group learns that the wardens are drow who
						come three times every 24 hours (or every 48 pulses of one of the more prominent patches
						of flourescent fungi).They also tell the group that they arrived in a stupor and fell unconcious
						onto the floor for several hours before waking now.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Soon several drow arrive and take 2 of the group, along with 4 other prisoners out for hard labor.
						This happens 3 times before the adventurers are able to rest, with duties including shit-squeegeeing,
						rock breaking, rope coiling, rock piling, and bucket-lift operating. The upshot of this being that
						by the end of the third shift your group has a fair idea of the extents of the prison and its grounds.
						Most of the labor is uneventful, although <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> gets into trouble not lifting
						rocks with enough gusto and is clocked by a nearby Quaggoth. Galifraen feigns unconciousness in order to avoid
						further degrading himslef with rock piling.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						A period of inactiivty follows the third shift of hard labor and gruel is brought to the cell. The party 
						considered their predicament and ask for a show of hands of those who would like to escape, all of the prisoners
						except the Dark Elf, <span class="npc">Sareth</span> indicate they wish to escape. Zodius and a egg-shaped sentient
						fungus become friends, and Stool creates a telepathic link between all of the prisoners. The Kuo-Toa yogi, <span class="npc">
						Shushaar</span>, breaks his silence and shares some gossip on one of the more important drow in the prison. According
						to Shushaar, a drow name <span class="npc">Jorlan</span> was recently disfigured in combat and has lost the favor of his
						lover, the commander of the prison, <span class="npc">Ilvara</span>, a drow high priestess. To make matters worse
						Ilvara has taken a new lover from among the drow at the prison further embittering Jorlan. Armed with this intel the 
						party plots to exploit Jorlans pain for their own benefit.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						During the next days hard labor <span class="pc">Moa</span> speaks with Jorlan, but is met with cold disinterest
						when she offers him the aid of the prisoners. Later Galifraen gets into trouble again, this by
						making indecent remarks concerning a neaby drow priestess to the guards. The guards decide to feed
						him to the giant spiders living in the webs below the prison but decide 4 bolts to the torso adequate punishment
						instead. Jorlan comes to the gate of the cell later and without prompting offers to leave the gate open
						for the party on the following day. The party agrees and eagerly await their escape.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After a third day of menial labor Jorlan returns, and discreetly unlocks the gate while collecting the gruel
						bowls. He then leaves and Galifraen's keen eyes notice him leading away two of the guards in the chamber beyond 
						the slave pen. Everin and Seven-Stars sneak out and across the bridge, and botch an attempt to garrote the lone
						remaining guard. The rest of the group hustles across the narrow bridge and into the guardroom and quickly dispatch 
						him silently. In hurried movements the group arm themselves with crossbows and swords, some choosing armor 
						as well. Ront cleaves the silk bridge that connects the slave pen and guard house which alerts the guards and
						a battle ensues!
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Galifraen is the first to leap into the spiderwebs below, with Zodius hanging onto his tunic. The land and
						are stuck, with 4 giant spiders approaching and drow shooting down at them with crossbows. The ensuing seconds 
						are a chaos of fighting and desparate wriggling in the webs. Shuushar is dragged away by spiders and Ront is 
						felled by arrows. Quaggoths demonstate their ability to climb cliff faces and close in. Zodius, Oni, Everin and 
						Moa escape the webs and leap into the water below. Stool, Eldeth, Sareth and Derendil also escape. Those remaining
						find themselves pressed by the quaggoth, drow and spiders. Galifraen narrowly avoids recapture in the webs and 
						leaps into the pool as well.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Below on the cavern floor, pursued by quaggoth, the party escape through a passage into a maze of tunnels. For now 
						they have escaped the drow, but they will need food and water soon... hunger may yet prove a crueler master than 
						any drow.

					<h3>
						Session 5: The Wyvern's Tale
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						A new day dawns in <span class="location">Ashabenford</span> and two
						new adventurers enter town with the dawn. <span class="pc">Lilly-Warrior</span>
						awakens in an alley recovering from a concussion suffered in
						an unremembered past. She overhears Galifraen, Everin, and Oni
						discussing matters outside <span class="location">The White Hart Inn</span>
						before going inside. Down the lane, another newcomer, <span id="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						also hears the conversations and is drawn to to signet rings the two
						speakers are wearing.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Everin and Oni play at dice and drink inside the Inn while 
						Galifraen broods. Seven-Stars enters the inn and while the 
						stable boy/barkeep <span class="npc">Barnaby</span> leaves
						SS borrows a fancy mug from behind the bar and pours himself
						a drink, then sits down next to Galifraen, disturbing the high-elf.
						Oni helps Lilly-Warrior with her head injury before the innkeep 
						returns and, perceiving SS's ruse about Galifraen drinking from 
						the mug, kick SS out of the bar. The innkeep then describes
						a ranger, known as <span class="npc">Zoloft</span> who may
						be able to help the group find drow and wyverns in the forest.
						Zoloft conveniently appears and offers his services in aquiring
						wyvern stingers, explaining that the mage <span class="npc">Noristuor</span>
						has hired him to help. The group enlists the aid of SS and Lilly-Warrior
						before leaving town with in their Wagon, with Moa in horse form pulling.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The first day's travel takes you out of town north along the 
						road called the 'Moonsea Ride'. You pass through many farms
						and fields. It being late autumn there are numerous squash and
						grains growing in the fields. By nightfall you have left the main
						road and traveled to the edge of the forest which Zoloft calls 
						'The Rimwood'. Before bedding down for the night you are attacked
						by two owl-bears which you quickly dispatch. Lilly-Warrior, who
						was concerned about not having enough to eat makes use of the bear
						meat.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The next day takes you through the Rimwood, which is sparesly
						populated with pines and low shrubs. Insects and numerous 
						and by nightfall Zoloft admits he is lost but assures you tomorrow
						will find you a wyvern. Before bedding down Moa holds an audience
						with the local ants and drives them off with bad-vibes, in exchange
						for a wasp sting.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The third day brings you into the 'Midwood', which is cooler, more
						humid, and more crowded with trees. Oak and maple are common and small
						mammals are common. By evening Zoloft has found a wyvern lair by a creek
						and he explains that you are in a area of the forest where animal diets
						are inverted - so the wyvern should be herbiverous and therfore less
						challenging to slay. You prepare a snare trap and await the beast, rubbing
						yourselves in red maple to mask your scent from it.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The wyvern arrives and is fooled by a spread of fruit illusioned by 
						Zodius. The trap works as well and your group lays into the beast, 
						slaying it without too much trouble. Unfortunately strange magic
						and a drow ambush immediately follow your victory and in less than
						a minute your entire group, except possibly Zoloft, have succumbed
						to the ambush.

						What dark fate awaits you now... in the hands of the drow.

						Session 4: Back in Town
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You traveled back to Ashabenford, collecting Torgo, the awkward
							butler from the mansion, on your way. Moa spent the night stealing
							a horse from
						<span class="location">
							Kaulvaeras Stables
						</span>
						and the
							follwing morning looking for healing potion ingredients. She found
							catstongue.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Galifraen traveled to the home of the town Magistrate, 
							a human male named
						<span class="npc">
							Haresk Malorn
						</span>
						who 
							was preoccupied with taking notes and saying "yes" at
							odd intervals. Haresk directed Galifraen to see
						<span class="npc">
							Goliaoh
						</span>
						who offered a reward of 3 gp for drow heads and more if the party
							could determine the source of the drow attacks on the town.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Everin met with an innkeep and arms dealer at
						<span class="location">
							The 
							Ashabenford Arms
						</span>
						and bartered for a shortsword and studded leather armor.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Onnie sold a jester cap to
						<span class="npc">
							Markov
						</span>
						a middle-aged
							human female who ran the general store. Onnie then went to
						<span class="location">
							Multhimmer's Trading Post
						</span>
						and sold the voodoo doll and monkey paw. She then
							went to the potion shop owned by
						<span class="npc">
							Almaes
						</span>
						, an old
							gnome female and purchased two healing potions.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Zodius visited the town's resident reclusive wizard,

							Noristuor
						</span>
						who was rude and dismissive but offered to buy 3 wyvern stingers for 200 gp if
							Zodius could get them from some of the beasts living in the caves to the north of
							town. Zodius also visted Almaes and purchased a lesser healing potion.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You then gathered outside of town and are thinking of hiring a guide to seek out
							the wyverns to collect their stingers. After which you will seek out the source of

					<h3>
						Session 4
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You and your fellows dosed on the purple powder and entered
						a dream realm much like the mansion. A satyr-like man attacked
						and you managed to slay him, though some of you suffered very
						bad dreams following the encounter. With his defeat you went
						outside and collected the last of the 4 shards which you then
						took into the cellar.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The demon Donamoth appeared in the fog surrounding his lair
						and boasted before vanishing. After some attempts at entering
						the fog while holding the shards one slipped out of hand and
						into the barrier, seemingly weakening it. You let go the remaining
						shards and the barrier fell, revealing a circular chamber covered
						over with diabolic runes where Donamoth waited.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After a brief dialog your group attacked the demon and managed
						to dispatch the brute without much trouble. Though he left behind
						nothing Galifraen examined a sarcophagus in the chamber and learned
						it contained the remains of a ward who died, along with six others,
						to bind some great evil. You went outside and found that the 
						mansion was no longer trapped within the impenetrable fog... you
						were free! Before leaving you investigated the chest upstairs and
						found a dandy, calling himself
						<span class="npcName">
							Dbard
						</span>
						inside. He promised to write of your exploits and pay you half his 
						earnings for one nights performance if you spared  him.
					</p>

				<section id="session0.3">
					<h3>
						Session 3
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Before settling into a short rest your previously vanquished
						foe rose up from the floor and landed one last blow before
						expiring. Your rest completed, you continued to explore the
						second floor of the mansion and encountered the demonic face
						of your host who took control of a stuffed wolf-man and
						attacked you! Then you smashed the jade figurine you obtained
						earlier to see what was inside, you found jade dust. Shortly
						after a toy room with a malicious leprechaun doll also attacked
						you. You managed to destroy both but were in need of rest so
						returned downstairs and barricaded yourselves with REW RA in
						the dining room. Your rest was interrupted by two unfortunate
						Red Listens who you quickly slew before completing your 
						long naps.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Refreshed you continue to explore and in the cellar and found
						an ancient sword in a passage behind some wine casks. You also
						had a brief interview with the host who appeared on the surface
						of a seemingly impenetrable barrier of fog. The head made clear
						it wants you dead... but you already knew that. Traveling back
						outside you found that the 4 statues in the garden had transformed
						and that each appear to represent a powerful servant of Donamoth, 
						two of the statues had crumbled revealing a purple fist-sized shard
						within which you took. You then found Torgo in some bushes and 
						learned that one of the powerful being represented by the statues,
						"Kruugar the dream sage", was only to be found within
						your heads - and that he came only while you slept. You decided
						to go to the greenhouse first and there slew a plant-elf horror
						without much trouble.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Returning to the house you investigated what you believe to 
						be the only remaining rooms downstairs and slew several more
						Red Listen cultists who had barricaded themselves in an attempt 
						to escape your wrath. While completing your sweep of the downstairs
						you passed through a library where a decapitated cultist lay. You
						took the book he was reading and two other books bound similarly
						as well as a text on alchemical reagents. With the mansion
						apparently cleared of foes (except for the host trapped in the 
						cellar) you gathered in the parlor and discussed attempting to
						sleep as a means of encountering Kruugar.

					<h3>
						Session 2
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The host arrived and asked you all to play a guessing game. He was a middle-aged human with a large mustache and a red face and his likeness appeared on the staues in the courtyard, leading you to believe he was Quincy. However he appears to be some kind of monster who inhabited Quincy's body! You learned all this when he ambushed your group with animated chairs and murdered Brunor. After you smashed the chairs and slew the insane serving maid the head of a demon appeared in the fireplace and "ate" Brunor's soul. It then swore to eat your souls as well before vanishing in the flames.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Your group left the dining area
						and began to to explore the mansion, except for REW RA who slept
						soundly on the dining table. Soon you ran into Torgo again, who was
						being bullied by a scrawny youth with a pimply face in a large
						red-cowled robe. You slew the youth with a single arrow as he
						turned to attack you and asked Torgo about what was going on. Torgo
						took a long time to explain but the gist was that:
					</p>
					<ul class="Chapter_CORE-BULLETED">
						<li>
							A group calling itself the "Red Listens", wearing red robes believe that an army of extra-planar creatures will dominate this world soon.
						</li>
						<li>
							10 days ago the leaders of the group were instructed to come to the mansion to free one said extra-planar creatures
						</li>
						<li>
							The cultists came and slew everyone in the mansion
						</li>
						<li>
							In the cellar a coffin was opened by the group and the entity within in possessed the body of the manison's owner.
						</li>
						<li>
							This owner, who Torgo called "The Master", then altered the 4 chief members of the Red Listens in some way to make them more powerful.
						</li>
						<li>
							One was made strong (Torgo's Uncle), another was made small, the third vanished when he slept and now walks in dreams, and the fourth died during the process.
						</li>
						<li>
							When the third died one of the guests at the mansions before the attack was found hiding in the green house and was changed "into a bush er--- planted".
						</li>
						<li>
							Some "ancient things" (valuables) are upstairs
						</li>
						<li>
							Torgo wants to leave and is hiding outside among the hedges in the courtyard for now.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After Galifraen aquired some archaic but functional chainmail you traveled upstairs in search of valuables. Passing by an enchanted suit of armor that strikes out with it's halbered at anyone who gets close, you slew 2 sleeping cultists and tricked a third, and rather vain cultist who you then killed. On him you found some strange purple powder which induces a deep sleep on anyone who comes into contact with it. Later you found a shit-covered lavatory, and looked out over a large balcony to discover that the world outside was somehow cut-off by a great amber-red cloud of fog. Attempting to pass through the fog with Horace the owl proved unfruitful - some kind of spacial distortion prevent travel much beyond 80' of the mansion roof, and probably halts travel beyond or to the gate. You also found a trunk in a room which held some frightened creature but you decided not to attempt to open the chest by force and instead locked it.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Back inside you found two more cultists looking for a hand like object in a room of curios, along with a brute of a man who stood by silently. One of you passes himself off as a cultist again and stabbed the large man, but was brutally repaid with a blow which knocked him unconcious. A unpleasant fight ensued but your group emerged victorious, though wounded.

						Session 1
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
						Most of you received an unusual letter in the mail which read:
						<br>
					</p>
					<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
						Dear friend,
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						I, Jerfort Qunicy Wutherton III, cordially invite you to attend supper at my country home in Mistledale. You may have heard of me from my exploits abroad.
								I am enclosing 10 sovereigns in the hope that you will find them sufficient cause to attend the meeting I have planned.
								Arrangments have been made at the White Hart Inn in Ashabenford for your reception should you arrive early.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						Please do come, I am not a spiritual man but have had strange dreams of late, and believe our fates are somehow intertwined.
								I feel I somehow owe you a debt, and hope meeting with you personally will jog my memory... The innkeep at the White Stag 
								will have instructions for you once you arrive.
						<br>
						Your friend,
						<br>
						Quincy
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You decided to head to The White Stag, and met several other adventurers who had received similiar letters, save for Ottie, who had seen all of the letter-holders in a dream.
						After some discussion you decided to travel with these adventurers
						to the Manor and asked around the tavern for information on Quincy. You learned that he was well respected as an explorer and collector of exotic relics. A while later rustic 
						coach arrived (more of a straw wagon) and took you out of town on a 2-hour journey along the forest's edge. At some point on the ride a wolf print was found, as well as some
						light shining from among the trees in the distance. Your driver was friendly, though he knew little of Quincy.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Arriving at the gates of the mansion you observed a roughly 200-year-old building, fit for a noble. You proceeded into the courtyard and noted several statues
						with plaques depicting Quincy in various heroic poses in exotic lands. Knocking at the front door you met Torgo, the awkward butler of the estate. Torgo led you
						into the dining room where you met another guest who called himself "Brunor". Torgo poured drinks while Brunor asked you about yourselves, and you learned that Brunor
						had received a letter similiar to yours and that he is a grain merchant. Rew ate some of the bread and fell into a deep sleep while the rest of you spoke with each other
						and waited for the host to arrive.
