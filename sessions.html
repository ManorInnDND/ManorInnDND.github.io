					Below are the sessions following our campaign based on the <em>Out of the Abyss</em> 
					campaign setting.
				</p>
				<section id="session1">
					<h3>
						Session 6: Prisonbreak!
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You awaken in a daze on cold stone floor of a slave pen deep underground. All of the
						group is present, as well as 10 other captives. All your possessions, except your
						clothes, have been taken. <span class="pc">Everin</span> speaks  undercommon and enables
						the rest of the group to converse with several of the inmates, the most talkataive of which
						is <span class="npc">Jimjar</span>. <a href="importantnpcs.html#session1Prisoners">The other prisoners</a> that the wardens are drow who
						come three times every 24 hours (or every 48 pulses of one of the more prominent patches
						of flourescent fungi).They also tell the group that they arrived in a stupor and fell unconcious
						onto the floor for several hours before waking now.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Soon several drow arrive and take 2 of the group, along with 4 other prisoners out for hard labor.
						This happens 3 times before the adventurers are able to rest, with duties including shit-squeegeeing,
						rock breaking, rope coiling, rock piling, and bucket-lift operating. The upshot of this being that
						by the end of the third shift your group has a fair idea of the extents of the prison and its grounds.
						Most of the labor is uneventful, although <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> gets into trouble not lifting
						rocks with enough gusto and is clocked by a nearby Quaggoth. Galifraen feigns unconciousness in order to avoid
						further degrading himslef with rock piling.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						A period of inactiivty follows the third shift of hard labor and gruel is brought to the cell. The party 
						considered their predicament and ask for a show of hands of those who would like to escape, all of the prisoners
						except the Dark Elf, <span class="npc">Sareth</span> indicate they wish to escape. Zodius and a egg-shaped sentient
						fungus become friends, and Stool creates a telepathic link between all of the prisoners. The Kuo-Toa yogi, <span class="npc">
						Shushaar</span>, breaks his silence and shares some gossip on one of the more important drow in the prison. According
						to Shushaar, a drow name <span class="npc">Jorlan</span> was recently disfigured in combat and has lost the favor of his
						lover, the commander of the prison, <span class="npc">Ilvara</span>, a drow high priestess. To make matters worse
						Ilvara has taken a new lover from among the drow at the prison further embittering Jorlan. Armed with this intel the 
						party plots to exploit Jorlans pain for their own benefit.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						During the next days hard labor <span class="pc">Moa</span> speaks with Jorlan, but is met with cold disinterest
						when she offers him the aid of the prisoners. Later Galifraen gets into trouble again, this by
						making indecent remarks concerning a neaby drow priestess to the guards. The guards decide to feed
						him to the giant spiders living in the webs below the prison but decide 4 bolts to the torso adequate punishment
						instead. Jorlan comes to the gate of the cell later and without prompting offers to leave the gate open
						for the party on the following day. The party agrees and eagerly await their escape.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After a third day of menial labor Jorlan returns, and discreetly unlocks the gate while collecting the gruel
						bowls. He then leaves and Galifraen's keen eyes notice him leading away two of the guards in the chamber beyond 
						the slave pen. Everin and Seven-Stars sneak out and across the bridge, and botch an attempt to garrote the lone
						remaining guard. The rest of the group hustles across the narrow bridge and into the guardroom and quickly dispatch 
						him silently. In hurried movements the group arm themselves with crossbows and swords, some choosing armor 
						as well. Ront cleaves the silk bridge that connects the slave pen and guard house which alerts the guards and
						a battle ensues!
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Galifraen is the first to leap into the spiderwebs below, with Zodius hanging onto his tunic. The land and
						are stuck, with 4 giant spiders approaching and drow shooting down at them with crossbows. The ensuing seconds 
						are a chaos of fighting and desparate wriggling in the webs. Shuushar is dragged away by spiders and Ront is 
						felled by arrows. Quaggoths demonstate their ability to climb cliff faces and close in. Zodius, Oni, Everin and 
						Moa escape the webs and leap into the water below. Stool, Eldeth, Sareth and Derendil also escape. Those remaining
						find themselves pressed by the quaggoth, drow and spiders. Galifraen narrowly avoids recapture in the webs and 
						leaps into the pool as well.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Below on the cavern floor, pursued by quaggoth, the party escape through a passage into a maze of tunnels. For now 
						they have escaped the drow, but they will need food and water soon... hunger may yet prove a crueler master than 
						any drow.

					<h3>
						Session 5: The Wyvern's Tale
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						A new day dawns in <span class="location">Ashabenford</span> and two
						new adventurers enter town with the dawn. <span class="pc">Lilly-Warrior</span>
						awakens in an alley recovering from a concussion suffered in
						an unremembered past. She overhears Galifraen, Everin, and Oni
						discussing matters outside <span class="location">The White Hart Inn</span>
						before going inside. Down the lane, another newcomer, <span id="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						also hears the conversations and is drawn to to signet rings the two
						speakers are wearing.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Everin and Oni play at dice and drink inside the Inn while 
						Galifraen broods. Seven-Stars enters the inn and while the 
						stable boy/barkeep <span class="npc">Barnaby</span> leaves
						SS borrows a fancy mug from behind the bar and pours himself
						a drink, then sits down next to Galifraen, disturbing the high-elf.
						Oni helps Lilly-Warrior with her head injury before the innkeep 
						returns and, perceiving SS's ruse about Galifraen drinking from 
						the mug, kick SS out of the bar. The innkeep then describes
						a ranger, known as <span class="npc">Zoloft</span> who may
						be able to help the group find drow and wyverns in the forest.
						Zoloft conveniently appears and offers his services in aquiring
						wyvern stingers, explaining that the mage <span class="npc">Noristuor</span>
						has hired him to help. The group enlists the aid of SS and Lilly-Warrior
						before leaving town with in their Wagon, with Moa in horse form pulling.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The first day's travel takes you out of town north along the 
						road called the 'Moonsea Ride'. You pass through many farms
						and fields. It being late autumn there are numerous squash and
						grains growing in the fields. By nightfall you have left the main
						road and traveled to the edge of the forest which Zoloft calls 
						'The Rimwood'. Before bedding down for the night you are attacked
						by two owl-bears which you quickly dispatch. Lilly-Warrior, who
						was concerned about not having enough to eat makes use of the bear
						meat.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The next day takes you through the Rimwood, which is sparesly
						populated with pines and low shrubs. Insects and numerous 
						and by nightfall Zoloft admits he is lost but assures you tomorrow
						will find you a wyvern. Before bedding down Moa holds an audience
						with the local ants and drives them off with bad-vibes, in exchange
						for a wasp sting.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The third day brings you into the 'Midwood', which is cooler, more
						humid, and more crowded with trees. Oak and maple are common and small
						mammals are common. By evening Zoloft has found a wyvern lair by a creek
						and he explains that you are in a area of the forest where animal diets
						are inverted - so the wyvern should be herbiverous and therfore less
						challenging to slay. You prepare a snare trap and await the beast, rubbing
						yourselves in red maple to mask your scent from it.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The wyvern arrives and is fooled by a spread of fruit illusioned by 
						Zodius. The trap works as well and your group lays into the beast, 
						slaying it without too much trouble. Unfortunately strange magic
						and a drow ambush immediately follow your victory and in less than
						a minute your entire group, except possibly Zoloft, have succumbed
						to the ambush.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
						What dark fate awaits you now... in the hands of the drow.

					<h3>
						Session 4: Back in Town
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You traveled back to Ashabenford, collecting Torgo, the awkward
							butler from the mansion, on your way. Moa spent the night stealing
							a horse from
						<span class="location">
							Kaulvaeras Stables
						</span>
						and the
							follwing morning looking for healing potion ingredients. She found
							catstongue.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Galifraen traveled to the home of the town Magistrate, 
							a human male named
						<span class="npc">
							Haresk Malorn
						</span>
						who 
							was preoccupied with taking notes and saying "yes" at
							odd intervals. Haresk directed Galifraen to see
						<span class="npc">
							Goliaoh
						</span>
						who offered a reward of 3 gp for drow heads and more if the party
							could determine the source of the drow attacks on the town.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Everin met with an innkeep and arms dealer at
						<span class="location">
							The 
							Ashabenford Arms
						</span>
						and bartered for a shortsword and studded leather armor.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Onnie sold a jester cap to
						<span class="npc">
							Markov
						</span>
						a middle-aged
							human female who ran the general store. Onnie then went to
						<span class="location">
							Multhimmer's Trading Post
						</span>
						and sold the voodoo doll and monkey paw. She then
							went to the potion shop owned by
						<span class="npc">
							Almaes
						</span>
						, an old
							gnome female and purchased two healing potions.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Zodius visited the town's resident reclusive wizard,
						<span class="npc">
							Noristuor
						</span>
						who was rude and dismissive but offered to buy 3 wyvern stingers for 200 gp if
							Zodius could get them from some of the beasts living in the caves to the north of
							town. Zodius also visted Almaes and purchased a lesser healing potion.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You then gathered outside of town and are thinking of hiring a guide to seek out
							the wyverns to collect their stingers. After which you will seek out the source of
							the drow.

					The Spoooooky Mansion (Levels 1 - 2)

				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
					Below are the session synopses which took place during our
					first adventure, "The Spoooooky Mansion".

				<section id="session0.4">
					<h3>
						Session 4
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You and your fellows dosed on the purple powder and entered
						a dream realm much like the mansion. A satyr-like man attacked
						and you managed to slay him, though some of you suffered very
						bad dreams following the encounter. With his defeat you went
						outside and collected the last of the 4 shards which you then
						took into the cellar.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The demon Donamoth appeared in the fog surrounding his lair
						and boasted before vanishing. After some attempts at entering
						the fog while holding the shards one slipped out of hand and
						into the barrier, seemingly weakening it. You let go the remaining
						shards and the barrier fell, revealing a circular chamber covered
						over with diabolic runes where Donamoth waited.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After a brief dialog your group attacked the demon and managed
						to dispatch the brute without much trouble. Though he left behind
						nothing Galifraen examined a sarcophagus in the chamber and learned
						it contained the remains of a ward who died, along with six others,
						to bind some great evil. You went outside and found that the 
						mansion was no longer trapped within the impenetrable fog... you
						were free! Before leaving you investigated the chest upstairs and
						found a dandy, calling himself
						<span class="npcName">
							Dbard
						</span>
						inside. He promised to write of your exploits and pay you half his 
						earnings for one nights performance if you spared  him.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session0.3">
					<h3>
						Session 3
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Before settling into a short rest your previously vanquished
						foe rose up from the floor and landed one last blow before
						expiring. Your rest completed, you continued to explore the
						second floor of the mansion and encountered the demonic face
						of your host who took control of a stuffed wolf-man and
						attacked you! Then you smashed the jade figurine you obtained
						earlier to see what was inside, you found jade dust. Shortly
						after a toy room with a malicious leprechaun doll also attacked
						you. You managed to destroy both but were in need of rest so
						returned downstairs and barricaded yourselves with REW RA in
						the dining room. Your rest was interrupted by two unfortunate
						Red Listens who you quickly slew before completing your 
						long naps.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Refreshed you continue to explore and in the cellar and found
						an ancient sword in a passage behind some wine casks. You also
						had a brief interview with the host who appeared on the surface
						of a seemingly impenetrable barrier of fog. The head made clear
						it wants you dead... but you already knew that. Traveling back
						outside you found that the 4 statues in the garden had transformed
						and that each appear to represent a powerful servant of Donamoth, 
						two of the statues had crumbled revealing a purple fist-sized shard
						within which you took. You then found Torgo in some bushes and 
						learned that one of the powerful being represented by the statues,
						"Kruugar the dream sage", was only to be found within
						your heads - and that he came only while you slept. You decided
						to go to the greenhouse first and there slew a plant-elf horror
						without much trouble.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Returning to the house you investigated what you believe to 
						be the only remaining rooms downstairs and slew several more
						Red Listen cultists who had barricaded themselves in an attempt 
						to escape your wrath. While completing your sweep of the downstairs
						you passed through a library where a decapitated cultist lay. You
						took the book he was reading and two other books bound similarly
						as well as a text on alchemical reagents. With the mansion
						apparently cleared of foes (except for the host trapped in the 
						cellar) you gathered in the parlor and discussed attempting to
						sleep as a means of encountering Kruugar.

					<h3>
						Session 2
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						The host arrived and asked you all to play a guessing game. He was a middle-aged human with a large mustache and a red face and his likeness appeared on the staues in the courtyard, leading you to believe he was Quincy. However he appears to be some kind of monster who inhabited Quincy's body! You learned all this when he ambushed your group with animated chairs and murdered Brunor. After you smashed the chairs and slew the insane serving maid the head of a demon appeared in the fireplace and "ate" Brunor's soul. It then swore to eat your souls as well before vanishing in the flames.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Your group left the dining area
						and began to to explore the mansion, except for REW RA who slept
						soundly on the dining table. Soon you ran into Torgo again, who was
						being bullied by a scrawny youth with a pimply face in a large
						red-cowled robe. You slew the youth with a single arrow as he
						turned to attack you and asked Torgo about what was going on. Torgo
						took a long time to explain but the gist was that:
					</p>
					<ul class="Chapter_CORE-BULLETED">
						<li>
							A group calling itself the "Red Listens", wearing red robes believe that an army of extra-planar creatures will dominate this world soon.
						</li>
						<li>
							10 days ago the leaders of the group were instructed to come to the mansion to free one said extra-planar creatures
						</li>
						<li>
							The cultists came and slew everyone in the mansion
						</li>
						<li>
							In the cellar a coffin was opened by the group and the entity within in possessed the body of the manison's owner.
						</li>
						<li>
							This owner, who Torgo called "The Master", then altered the 4 chief members of the Red Listens in some way to make them more powerful.
						</li>
						<li>
							One was made strong (Torgo's Uncle), another was made small, the third vanished when he slept and now walks in dreams, and the fourth died during the process.
						</li>
						<li>
							When the third died one of the guests at the mansions before the attack was found hiding in the green house and was changed "into a bush er--- planted".
						</li>
						<li>
							Some "ancient things" (valuables) are upstairs
						</li>
						<li>
							Torgo wants to leave and is hiding outside among the hedges in the courtyard for now.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						After Galifraen aquired some archaic but functional chainmail you traveled upstairs in search of valuables. Passing by an enchanted suit of armor that strikes out with it's halbered at anyone who gets close, you slew 2 sleeping cultists and tricked a third, and rather vain cultist who you then killed. On him you found some strange purple powder which induces a deep sleep on anyone who comes into contact with it. Later you found a shit-covered lavatory, and looked out over a large balcony to discover that the world outside was somehow cut-off by a great amber-red cloud of fog. Attempting to pass through the fog with Horace the owl proved unfruitful - some kind of spacial distortion prevent travel much beyond 80' of the mansion roof, and probably halts travel beyond or to the gate. You also found a trunk in a room which held some frightened creature but you decided not to attempt to open the chest by force and instead locked it.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Back inside you found two more cultists looking for a hand like object in a room of curios, along with a brute of a man who stood by silently. One of you passes himself off as a cultist again and stabbed the large man, but was brutally repaid with a blow which knocked him unconcious. A unpleasant fight ensued but your group emerged victorious, though wounded.

					<h3>
						Session 1
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
						Most of you received an unusual letter in the mail which read:
						<br>
					</p>
					<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
						Dear friend,
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						I, Jerfort Qunicy Wutherton III, cordially invite you to attend supper at my country home in Mistledale. You may have heard of me from my exploits abroad.
								I am enclosing 10 sovereigns in the hope that you will find them sufficient cause to attend the meeting I have planned.
								Arrangments have been made at the White Hart Inn in Ashabenford for your reception should you arrive early.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						Please do come, I am not a spiritual man but have had strange dreams of late, and believe our fates are somehow intertwined.
								I feel I somehow owe you a debt, and hope meeting with you personally will jog my memory... The innkeep at the White Stag 
								will have instructions for you once you arrive.
						<br>
						Your friend,
						<br>
						Quincy
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						You decided to head to The White Stag, and met several other adventurers who had received similiar letters, save for Ottie, who had seen all of the letter-holders in a dream.
						After some discussion you decided to travel with these adventurers
						to the Manor and asked around the tavern for information on Quincy. You learned that he was well respected as an explorer and collector of exotic relics. A while later rustic 
						coach arrived (more of a straw wagon) and took you out of town on a 2-hour journey along the forest's edge. At some point on the ride a wolf print was found, as well as some
						light shining from among the trees in the distance. Your driver was friendly, though he knew little of Quincy.
					</p>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
						Arriving at the gates of the mansion you observed a roughly 200-year-old building, fit for a noble. You proceeded into the courtyard and noted several statues
						with plaques depicting Quincy in various heroic poses in exotic lands. Knocking at the front door you met Torgo, the awkward butler of the estate. Torgo led you
						into the dining room where you met another guest who called himself "Brunor". Torgo poured drinks while Brunor asked you about yourselves, and you learned that Brunor
						had received a letter similiar to yours and that he is a grain merchant. Rew ate some of the bread and fell into a deep sleep while the rest of you spoke with each other
						and waited for the host to arrive.
