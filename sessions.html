					Out of the Abyss (Level 2 - ?)
				</h2>
				<p>
					Below are the sessions following our campaign based on the <em>Out of the Abyss</em> 
					campaign setting.
				</p>
				<section id="session29">
					<h3>Session33: The Surface!</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The companions gather the loot from <span class="npc">Ilvara</span> and her minions before heading on toward 
						<span class="location">Mithril Hall</span>. At the lowest of the mines the party is blocked by a iron pipe wall 
						and gate guarded by a score of dwarven veterans. The leader of these dwarfs allows the group to pass after some questions. 
						The party notices several dead goblinoids around the gate.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group then heads up through the town, over the Undercity and into the Hall of Gathering where they learn about a hotsprings called
						<span class="location">Thermistor's Pool</span>
						and nearby opening to the surface. Deciding to head to the surface the group finds a shattered gate being repaired by stonemasons.
						Outside the air is below freezing and snow falls in powdery gusts. The sun, even through the dense clouds is nearly blinding after so 
						long underground.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Heading back into the town and to the tavern area the group stays the night at <span class="location">Garumn's Folly</span> where there is 
						gambling, drinking, and general good-will. There <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> regails many of the the innfolk with tales of the 
						parties exploits in the underdark. <span class="pc">Onnie</span> gets laid by <span class="npc">Friar Zak</span>. <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						steals an middle-aged woman's cane and smashes it upstairs to take the golden handle off it. <span class="pc">Francis</span> enquires about 
						the market and hotsprings learning both are outside of the town. And <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> is distracted. Lastly, <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						has a big goof trying to impress an attractive halfling maiden but collapses in his chair revealing an underdark louse in his beard. He later has a 
						mediocre dwarven style beard cut.
					</p>

				<section id="session28">
					<h3>Session 32: Showdown with Ilvara</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party and the drow battle for 4 hectic rounds. Ilvara is badly wounded by <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>
						at the start of the combat but her comrade priestees, <span class="npc">Asha</span>, is able to outlast 
						her and throws some unpleasant spells at the party, notably a swarm of biting flying spiders. <span class="pc">Francis</span>
						is in the thick of the fight as usual and takes a beating throughout the battle, while the other members of the crew take shots
						and cast spells at the drow. Finally the last drow falls and the group prepares to search their bodies and collect their scalps.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session27">
					<h3>Session 31: Blingdenston 11</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party returns to the town's surface out of the catacombs and secures the flaming glaive reward From
						the king and queen. That night the town celebrates the heroic deeds of the party and <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						get laid by "<span class="npc">Barbara</span>", the sister of <span class="npc">Finkle</span>.
						The next day they leave the town and head out toward <span class="location">Mithral Hall</span>.
						<span class="pc">Onnie</span> says goodbye to a heartbroken Finkle and Shithead insults him. <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						tries to convince Finkle to sneak onto the caravan but Finkle is to keen on obeying Onnie to listen. One of the 4
						caravan guards is <span class="npc">Smooth Headcap</span>, the gnome that the cat-hair toupe was made for. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The travel to Mithral hall takes one week, and the party encounters and rescues <span class="npc">Lethywin Silvergrace</span>, a male
						moon elf from the surface town of <span class="location">Silverymoon</span> from a hungry ooze. Two days later the group 
						encounters a pair of wounded orcs hiding in a cave, but decide to avoid a fight per <span class="pc">Francis</span> strong
						desire to treat the orcs fairly.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Just a day outside the dwarven city the group notices a tripline setup along the road and investiages to find <span class="npc">Ilvara</span>
						waiting in ambush. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> dispells the false walls the drow were hiding behind and the battle is joined.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Will the party survive another encouter with Ilvara and her minions? Will they be dragged back to Velkynevelve?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session26">
					<h3>Session 30: Blingdenstone 10</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The group is met by <span class="npc">Jadger</span> and several ghost guards and stone buddies who escort them through 
						the dangerous ooze-filled combat zone and into the safer region of settled <span class="location">Blingdenstone</span>.
						After a short while the king and queen meet the party and are very pleased with the results, though the wererats suffered
						terribly during the fight, the rest of the humanoids of Blingdenstone made out OK in the battle. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party then decides to investigate the whereabouts of <span class="npc">Baldini</span>. They hear from a mute child 
						that Baldini was seen entering the catacombs at the local church of Segoojan Earthcaller, <span class="location">The Ruby in the Rough</span>.
						They also learn the location of Baldini's home and exploring it find a journal describing Baldini's fracturing personality and plot
						against Blingdenstone and the Pudding King.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the temple outside the catacombs the party intimidates <span class="npc">Glyphic Shroombrite</span>, the temple's acolyte, into 
						leading them to Baldini. The party notices Glyphic scratching at his shoulder and cut away a foul boil growing there that had a 
						face beginning to appear on it. Glyphic then leads them down into the catacombs where <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> induces several
						of the ghost from the "traitor" section to join the group against Baldini. Axel and another deep gnome also accompany the party, as well 
						as Jadger.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group reaches a spookier-than-typical juncture in in the catacombs and begin hearing maddening whispers. Several of the traitor-ghosts
						seem particularly affected. Around the corner Baldini mutters to himself, and has sprouted a second baboon-like head. The group charges him after
						a debate on tactics and pillowcase strategems. Baldidni sprouts tentacles and several of the ghosts turn against the party but the fight is short
						and Baldini's heads are smashed and his body pierced into the floor.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Now the group prepares to return to the temple and obtain their reward (a magical glaive for <span class="pc">Francis</span>), as well
						as debark on the caravan headed to <span class="location">Mithril Hall</span>. But first they want to force the remaining traitor ghost
						to show them where the other traitor ghost that fled is buried so they can descrate its grave...
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session25">
					<h3>Session 29: Blingdenstone 9</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party manages to defeat the oozes, as <span class="pc">Onnie</span>'s wild magic continues to flare up,
						at one point summoning a clockwork creature with a pipeorgan built into its pyrimidal body. She also  gains
						the abilty to teleport at will and grows to a large size. 
						
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						When the group enters the puddin' Kings court they find a cavern draped with green slime in mock arrangment
						of court tapestries. The king screams at the adventurers in a rage as he is struck by an arrow and turns into
						a pudding himself.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The battle is short but treacherous, the king propelling frothy plumes of poisonous goo, nevertheless he is 
						slain and chortles as he melts away "You haven't won! No! We will rise from our childern! We will be reborn 
						from the faceless lord! Jubilex will consume the banquet of the Fungal Queen and we.. will... all... grow ... !"
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						As the puddle of ooze that was the king spreads across the floor two spellbooks bound in lizardskin can be seen.
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> snatches them up.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The battle can still be seen seen down the passage. The oozes are no longer coordinated but still appear too 
						numerous for the Blingdenstone locals to destroy, what will happen now?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session24">
					<h3>Session 28: Blingdenstone 8</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The group decides to head to see <span class="npc">Gurnik Tapfinger</span> and inform him of the 
						desturction of the drow statues. Gurnik is much pleased and leaves to banish the evil cloud
						of malignant dust. The group then decides to rest before heading to the council of war.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the council the party and the towns leaders agree on a strategy. The adventures will be a strike force
						tasked with sneaking into <span class="npc">The Pudding King</span>'s lair and killing him while the 
						main force of the army attacks the ooze filled chamber south of the king's court. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party meets with <span class="npc">Shinetail</span>, who leads them to a quiet tunnel in the wererat 
						district. Soon the sounds of battle can be heard and Shinetail leads the party through several passages 
						before a giant black pudding drops down onto him, dissolving his flesh into foul acrid fog. The pudding splits
						into four horse sized portions and attacks the group. During
						the fray the group learns that slashing damage splits the pudding and lightning damage heals it, and <span class="pc">Onnie</span>
						triggers an unstable surge of magic while healing <span class="npc">Finkle Tiptoes</span>. The puddings are eventually destroyed
						and the party rushed on towards the throne area.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						In another corridor the group encounters a ragged gnomish figure who commands and brain-like ooze and another black pudding to 
						destory the party. The gnome then flees towards the court and the party attacks the oozes. Onnie accidentally teleports next to the 
						group causing some dismay as magic around her is in dangerous flux. She then becomes confused. The brain ooze emits a psychic blast 
						which injures several party members, causing severe nosebleeds.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group is in a perilous position with two fearsome oozes assaulting them and Onnie's wild magic still flaring up. Will they succeed 
						against The Pudding King... will they even make it to the throne room?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session23">
					<h3>Session 27: Blingdenstone 7</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						While discussing possible attack strategies at the inn, the group decides to take on the drow statues for 
						the Emerald Enclave. Doing do should release the evil elemental influence in the <span class="location">Rockblight</span>
						area and enable the battle against the oozes to use reliable earth elemental reinforcments. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Returning to the cavern where the statues are the most of the group gets down to smashin' the drow to dust. <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						starts things off spicy with a fireball setting the tone for the battle (statues getting whupped). <span class="npc">Finkle</span> pulls
						severl kill steals on <span class="pc">Francis</span>, and a bless from <span class="pc">Shithead</span> keeps most of the party on 
						target. Once all the drow are destroyed <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>'s pet stone elemental that he release into the wild
						shows up enlarged and enraged. Feeding it shiny stones works for a moment before the group bashes the elemental into 5 pieces which also 
						attack. These are also dispatched quickly and a cloud of malevolent dust that makes everyone ornery fills the chamber. <span class="pc">Everin</span> 
						considers how to chisel or otherwise recover the scalps off the destroyed drow as the group head out of the anger-inducing cavern to report 
						the deed to <span class="pc">Nomi Pathsutter</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The council of war is tomorrow, will the Battle for Blingdenstone be too?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session22">
					<h3>Session 26: Blingdenstone 6</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The group takes the writ recognizing clan Goldwhisker as part of the settling clans of Blingdenstone back
						to <span class="npc">Chipgrin</span>. The praty then ask Chipgrin about the <span class="npc">Pudding King</span>
						and learn that his lair is guarded by many oozes. <span class="npc">Jadger</span> reveals himself by rising 
						out of the floor and suggests that a council of war be held to determine how to deal with the oozes. Consulting
						with <span class="npc">Gurnik Tapfinger</span> the group learns that stone elementals would make resilient allies
						against the oozes but that they will need to destroy the evil force that still dwells in the <span class="location">Rockblight</span>
						district before the stone elementals will be reliable.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With this information the party heads to <span class="location">The Stoneheart Enclave</span> and meet with 
						<span class="npc">Nomi Pathshutter</span>. They receive 1,400 gp in exchange for the evil elemental samples 
						they collected. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> and <span class="pc">Zodius</span> assist in researching
						the samples and <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> captures a pet evil mini charcoal elemental that hatched
						from one of the samples. Nomi makes contact with the entity and learns that it has taken refuge in the 30 
						drow statues, and that destroying the statues will enable the enclave to banish it. She then provides the 
						party with 3 anti-elemental grenades which, after being charged at the <span class="location">Steadfast Stone</span>,
						should help in destroying the statues.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Returning the Blingdenstone the party attend the Festival of Falling Stars and discourage <span class="npc">Sark</span>
						from commiting hate crimes against the wererats who came. Seven-Stars also gives his foul toupe to <span class="npc">Smooth Headcap</span>,
						the caravan guard who wanted hair to impress his girlfriend. The festival proves moving to most of the adventures, reminding
						them of the night sky they took for granted before being captured months ago. Zodius has a vision of the group making it 
						to the surface soon.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With nostalgic hearts the adventures return to the inn for rest and ale, and wait for the council of war to begin...
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session21">
					<h3>Session 25: Blingdenstone 5</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The group decides to leave the cleansed temple and head return to the safe portion of Blingdenstone.
						On their way back they notice several giant spiders on the ceiling overhead, spiders which appear 
						to have fiendish traits (scaly patches of hide). The group ignores these foes and returns to the 
						inn where they make a deal with the innkeeper to buy the medusa head. It remains unclear if the 
						the head is dangerous.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After several members get drunk and others retire the King and Queen of Blingdenstone summon
						the adventurers to their court and ask them to meet with the wererats who have requested the 
						adventuerers as mediators for the wererats and deep gnomes. The group agree and are 
						advised by the king to slay the rats if things go poorly. The deep gnome ghosts agree to 
						help defend the adventurers if they are attacked during the talks. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The concern of the deep gnome king seems unfounded, the leader of the wererats <span class="npc">Chipgrin</span>,
						seems friendly and shows the party the threat of the ooze invasion, as well as describing the leader of the oozes. 
						<span class="npc">Baldini</span> is also implicated as dealing with the oozes and supposedly has sprouted a second head.
						The group returns to the queen and king and it is agreed that the deep gnomes will ally with the wererats against the oozes.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						It is unclear when the oozes will attack, and what else the party can do to prepare, will they strike first?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session20">
					<h3>Session 24: Blingdenstone 4</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The menacing shadows are investigated by <span class="pc">Zodius</span>'s pet owl, Horace and are
						found to be a pair of wretched deep gnome wererats. There is debate over whether the group should 
						murder them but <span class="pc">Everin</span> convinces the group that killing is in poor taste in this
						case. The party then move back through the double gate leading into the safe portion of Blingdenstone and 
						retire to the <span class="location">Foaming Mug</span>, where the innkeeper, <span class="npc">Tappy Foamstrap</span>,
						eagerly listens to their bold tale of murdering the medusa. She mentions that the party should be able to 
						collect a reward for killing the medusa from the cynical gnome guard at the entrance to the <span class="location">Rockblight</span>
						area, a certain <span class="npc">Sark Axelbarrel</span>, or "Axel" for short. The party then retire to their rooms to rest.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arising, the group determines that they have about 24 hours left before the Festival of the Falling Star occurs, and decide
						that helping <span class="npc">Gurnik Tapfinger</span> by cleansing his church of evil elementals is the next task worth their
						time. Before returning to Rockblight they stop by the merchant quarter and purchase some potions from their merchant friend <span class="npc">Kazook Pickshine</span>.
						They then head back to Rockblight and, following directions given by Gurnik, they find <span class="location">The Steadfast Stone</span>,
						a large chamber with a 30' high socketed stone monolith. They place a hallowed ruby granted to them by Gurnik into the monolith and are 
						soon attacked by several waves of earth elementals. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The battle is long, perhaps the longest the group has face thus far. Six elementals rise up out of the very stones of the temple's walls 
						to attack the group, <span class="npc">Traps, Rusty, Turd, Bould, Glare</span> and, <span class="npc">Twitch</span> 
						<span class="pc">Onnie</span> and Everin are gravely injured several times but prompt healing from <span class="pc">Shithead</span> keeps them from perishing under
						the heavy blows of the elemental fists. As the battle drags on the magic of hallowed ruby amplified in the monolith and was channeled 
						by <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> into healing allies and smiting foes.
						<span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> pops crossbow shots for most of the battle but also nearly saves one of the friendly elementals
						from destruction with a bold Tai Chi move. 
						Finally, after nearly a dozen misfires, a mythic shot from Galifraen fells one of the last 
						two elementals. Moments later <span class="pc">Francis</span> destroys the last one. During the battle three smaller elementals known
						as "Galeb-Dur" animated near the monolith, and though one was destroyed during the battle the temple seems to have been successfully cleansed
						of evil. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With the elements vanquished the group nods to the solemn guardian elementals and consider resting again before deciding what to do next...						
					</p>

					<h3>Session 23: Blingdenstone 3</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="figure">
							<img src="/Introduction2-web-resources/images/Stabby.png" alt="stabby" height="300px" width="200px">
							Faces of Justice</span>A palaver over which direction to go ends with the group deciding to explore the crystal cavern
						overlooking the waterfall nearby. On the way up the stairs they are attacked by 2 gargoyles. <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						hides behind a boulder which turns into an earth elemental shortly thereafter. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> blasts the two 
						gargoyles out of the sky with his first fireball and <span class="pc">Francis</span> makes a brave show of riding the back 
						of the elemental and stabbing it with his recently acquired glaive. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After dispatching the elemental the party continues up into the crystal overlook and find little 
						of value, though <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> deduces that the area seems the most likely location of the Festival of the Falling
						stars that occurs in two days time. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group continues on into the northen portion of <span class="location">Rockblight</span>, and discover a central chamber with 4 passages
						leading out. Seven-Stars observes the finely preserved statue of a deep gnome holding a crystal, as if to shield it's eyes. The gnome is
						dressed in a warrior's garb and is possibly the gnome that Jadger is seeking. After determining that the gnome appears to be cringing 
						away from one of the passages the group decides to enter the passage opposite the ominous one. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Inside the "safer" passage the troupe encounter 30 statues of drow warriors which begin to animate and slowly pursue the adventurers back up 
						the stairs. The group flees back to the central chamber and is relieved to find that the statues only went so far as the stairs in their 
						pursuit. Holding another council, and learning of a finely decorated chamber at the end of the ominous passage, the crew opts to risk 
						death and bust in on whatever lies  beyond the door. Several stone rodents near the entrance to the chamber suggest to the group that 
						some sort of petrification may be chanced when fighting whatever the monster is.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Onnie</span> and Galifraen charge into the chamber and surpise a drow matron with white snakes instead 
						of hair. Zodius strongly suggests she close her eyes while Seven-Stars, <span class="pc">Shithead</span>, and <span class="pc">Everin</span>
						rush up and bind her with bedding and rope. The group then proceeds to shank her over 15 times in 12 seconds (thats over 1 shank per second) 
						before her ruined body lies dead upon the ground. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						This noble deed accomplished, the party congradulate themselves by looting her home, finding 3 valuable drow formal dresses, as well
						as a pair of deep gnomish spell gems. After a brief conferance over the medusa-drow's corpse, the adventurers decide to return to 
						the safe portion of Blingdenstone to rest and try and slang the medusa head, which they promptly cut off (careful to leave it wrapped in
						a bag). On their way out of Rockblight, they spot two small humanoid shapes hiding in the shadows.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Are the shadows powerful foes or innocent friends? Has Blingdenstone been attacked while the party was away? And 
						how much gold  will the medusa head fetch? Hopefully the adventurers will live to find out... 
					</p>

					<h3>
						Session 22: Blingdenstone 2
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Entering the catacombs the group meets with <span class="npc">Jadger</span>, a ghostly
						deep gnome who asks the group to help eliminate a dangerous ghost in the Residential Quarter
						as well as recover the bones of his lost comrade in arms. He also accepts <span class="npc">Pelek's</span>
						remains appreciatively. Many ghosts appear during the interaction with Jadger but are indifferent or 
						friendly with the adventurers. The group also learns of an evil force that turns the tamed earth elementals the 
						deep gnomes use as guards and companions into chaotic murderous brutes. This information interests the group so they
						set out looking for more information. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> also observes that the temple is lacking a statue
						and that it is dedicated to Segojan Earthcaller, the gnomish god of deep earth, nature, and the dead.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group leaves the catacombs looking for a guard to ask questions of, they find one immediately, praying at the temple's altar.
						The guard, <span class="npc">Finkle Tiptoes</span>, is at first angered at the groups request for information about the <span class="location">Stoneheart Enclave</span>,
						but he warms to <span class="pc">Onnie</span> and agrees to lead the group to the Enclave's holy summoning chamber, <span class="location">Stoneheart Quarry</span> an hour outside the town. 
						At the quarry the group meet <span class="npc">Nomi Pathshutter</span>, a deep gnome mage who relates who studies of the evil influence 
						to the group and raps with Zodius about the problem using the latest arcane terminology. From this chat the group learns that the 
						influence is believed to be "elemental from a theoretical plane of evil" or a "evil elemental", Nomi is unsure of which. She shows the group several
						charcoal colored rocks and offers the group 10 gp per "unit potency" for similar rocks they should find on the insane elementals in the Rockblight 
						area.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party returns to Blingdenstone and are invited by a server to an inn that has opened in town in their honor. They head to the 
						residential quarter. They meet <span class="npc">Tappy Foamstrap</span>, the proprietor, who asks them all manner of questions 
						and feeds them a hearty meal of traditional surface dweller food! The group is inspired to have this taste of home after months of 
						insects and fungi in the Underdark. Most of the group has some booze, the famous Darkstout Ale from <span class="location">Gracklestugh</span>,
						the brewery for which the party had seen during their stay in the duergar city. Buzzed and well fed the party heads to the Rockblight area.
					</p>	
					<p class="Core">
						Onnie convinces Finkle to accompany the group into the dangerous area. A cynical deep gnome guard insults Finkle and the group 
						before opening one of the two magical doors that form the barrier between the settled portion of Blingdenstone and the Rockblight. 
						Inside the Rockblight the group finds cold, draughty halls strewn with debris and dust. Soon they are attacked by a ghost which 
						creates a horrible vision of the sack of Blingdenstone, aging Onnie, Galifraen, and Zodious 20 to 30 years. Although Zodius and 
						Galifraen are not particularly concerned, Onnie is upset at missing her 20s by the curse and the group decides to try to find a cure.
						<span class="pc">Little Shithead</span> prays for guidance and learns that a powerful divine spell will be needed to reverse the effects,
						and that after 24 hours the effects will be permanent.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back in Blingdenstone proper the group meets the head priest of Callarduran Smoothhands, <span class="npc">Gurnik Tapfinger</span>,
						who was already cross with the party for being outsiders. He agrees to help them, but they must cleanse his former temple
						in the Rockblight area by placing a magical ruby in the "Steadfast Stone" of the temple's central chamber. He warns that  
						insane elementals of the area will be drawn to destroy the ruby once it is placed, and the party must defend it against them until
						the hallowing is complete. He then explains that he will need a ruby for each aging to be reversed, and the group sets out looking for
						rubies. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						They investigate the home of a unpleasant ghost, <span class="npc">Vahn</span>, and <span class="pc">Everin</span> finds and snatches 
						a jewelry box from the under the bed while the rest of the group mashes on the ghost. Enraged, the ghost attacks Everin but fails to 
						hit him, and is slain, it's spirit retreating into the box. The group opens the box in the presence of the meditating Gurnik to find 
						8 small rubies, and Onnie learns that one of them is cursed in some way. <span class="pc">Francis</span> picks up the cursed gem
						"so no one else will have to bear it", and seems to resist the gem's influence. Gurnik rises from his prayers and uses three of the gems
						to restore the aged adventueres their stolen years. He warns them that they will need to keep the ruby that cured them (now a simple stone),
						on their person for a years time or they risk aging again. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party returns to the Rockblight, is again insulted by the cynical gnome, but are unafraid of the ghost or it's disturbing 
						scene of slaughter this time.

						After a gruff interview through an impressively constructed magical door, the group is

						On the way to Blingdenstone the party met a deep gnome

						who offered to lead them to Blingdenstone. Two days after Baldini joined <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> caught him 
						attempting to steal an elven necklace and accidental shot Baldini with an arrow in an attempt to bloodlessly discourage the theif.
						Later still the group found another swarm of fire beetles, and used some stinky ingredients from <span class="pc">Zodius</span> pack
						to disperse them. On the fifthteenth day some unfortunate adventureres stumbled into a patch of deathly cold mold, and suffered
						severe chills. Only a day out of Blingdenstone the group fought a group of ferocious gnolls hunting some sort of tortoise shelled

						Session 19: Neverlight Grove 3
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						During the respite after the fight with <span class="npc">Yestabrod</span> several members of the party
						became agitated. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> became paralyzed from the neck down, <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>
						began speaking to an associate, "Tyler", that no one else could perceive... except for <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						who began to behave much like Galifraen. Little <span class="pc">Shithead</span> was also afflicted with some 
						strange disorder and became uncharacteristically frightened.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						In the midst of the groups confusion a troupe of 18 myconids arrived in the garden and began performing 
						a wedding rehersal, three of them posturing the dead body of Yestabrod as a priest. Zodius had recovered
						from his paralysis and asked some questions of the actors but was hushed. Most of the party watched the 
						ceremony and were favored with a disturbing vision of a leathery fungal woman, 13' tall, being tended
						by several bridesmaids. This vision caused further trouble in the minds of Galifraen and Seven-Stars with
						Galifraen running breifly toward the rehersal group before collapsing in a dialated-eyed heap. Seven-Stars
						began to perform somersaults and various acrobatic feats. As the rehersal party faded into the mists they began
						singing the same song they had been earlier:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						From rocky bed the roadstool rose,<br>
						From chaos dark, he love She shows.<br>
						Wish! Yearn! Laugh!<br>
						Crave! Hunger! Dance!<br>
						Her joyous spores will spread!<br>
						You is gone, beauty rots,<br>
						Araumycos and Zuggtmoy!<br>
						Joined together, heart to heart,<br>
						Becoming one, 'til death do part!<br>
						Hail! Hail! Hail!<br>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="Core">
						The party debated on heading further into the madness inducing mists, towards the mushroom tower, but decided
						againt it in favor of meeting with <span class="npc">Basidia</span> and resting. They left the garden without
						issue but found that most of the myconids were communing. One of the myconids, a being named <span class="npc">Morelo</span>,
						was able to provide the group with, as <span class="pc">Everin</span> requested, a "fine place to rest". Everin
						also managed to find a nice looking stick during his watch.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After the rest the group headed down to the court of the myconid sovereigns and were welcomed heartily by
						<span class="npc">Phylo</span>, who insisted they not spoil the surprise of the <span class="location">Garden of Welcome</span>
						to anyone who had not yet visited. Galifraen and Seven-Stars decided to stay and entertain Phylo while the 
						rest of the group met with Basidia.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Basidia communed with the party and found the visions they had most disturbing, it decided to lead the myconids
						who were still free of the corruption away from the grove and to endow <span class="npc">Stool</span> with 
						the memories of a deep gnome explorer so the group could travel to <span class="location">Blingdenstone</span>.
						Meanwhile Seven-Stars was putting on a world-class circus act, which so impressed Phylo that he was rewarded
						with a fine blue sapphire. Seven-Stars received another fine stone from Shithead who was launching them from
						a slingshot, hoping to silence the incessant clown music. Finally Basidia rewarded the group with a fine silver
						box containing 3 amethysts, 4 small diamonds, and 1 large diamond. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group left the grove before Basidia told Phylo its plans to leave so they do not know what happened. <span class="pc">Fancis</span>
						grumbled about not fighting the demon queen as the group started out on their 16 day journey to Blingdenstone. Seven-Stars, 
						Galifraen, and Everin were still acting strangely despite having rested and eaten well. The group also collected 50 days of 
						food and water from the grove and stored it their Bag of Holding before setting out. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the end of the first day's march Shithead and Francis heard a web-covered goblin stumbled past the groups resting spot. Shithead
						watched as 6 giant spiders scuttled after the goblin and Francis revealed his hate/fear of spiders. Early on the next day the 
						group walked into the lair of those same spiders and set it ablaze, killing 7 of the creatures in the process, though <span class="pc">Oni</span>
						was badly wounded.

					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Reaching the top of the terrace the group observed a disturbing courtyard flanked with twisted mushrooms and

					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Everin</span> spoke briefly with one of the heads, a drow, who begged for death, a wish Everin

					<p class="Core">
						The battle was short but perilous with the group surrounded by corpse-like creatures raised up from the fungal
						floor. The garden light darkened to a grisly purple-black and several corpses exploded on the group, hurting some

						Leaving <span class="location">Gracklstugh</span> with their entourage of 10 stoneguards the 
						group begins their 12 day journey to <span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>. The first several 
						days of travel occur across the dreaded <span class="location">Blacklake</span>, but are
						uneventful thanks to the masterful navigation of the duergar merchant's captain with whom the group
						travels. On the fourth day of sailing the group was landed on the northwest shore of the lake and

					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Four days away from the grove fungal growth along the passageways became increasingly common. A large
						fly-like monster with a horses mane attacked the group in one of the larger caverns and slew a duergar
						before being put down. The bear-servant demon was very upset about the groups killing of it's beautiful 
						comrade and was particulary orney with <span class="pc">Zodius</span> over the next few hours. After

						One day out from the grove a pair of sentient fungi (myconids) intercepted the group and took over for the

						meets with the group to explain that something is amiss with it's co-sovering, <span class="npc">Phylo</span>, who
						has been behaving erratically. Basidia explains that Phylo has began introducing ideas to the colony that are 
						fracturing their unity and has been promising a wondrous furture with the "seed mother". Basidia asks the group 
						to accept the invitation to <span class="location">The Garden of Welcome</span> from Phylo. Basidia also 
						noticed that <span class="npc">Sarith</span> appear to be host to some alien spores, not seeded from any colony

						caravan he was in was attacked by myconids and when he came to he was being imprisoned for killing his fellow

						Bursting into the cultist chamber the group began slaughtering the innocent derro, starting with 
						<span class="pc">Galifraen</span> sniping one of them in the head. <span class="pc">Oni</span> then
						attempted to eat 3 ounces of  mushrooms and double her stature but the last ounce
						made her violently ill. A two-headed giant tried to protect its derro friends from the bloodthirsty
						adventureres but was charmed into attacking them instead by a sinister suggesion from <span class="pc">Zodius</span>.
						The last surviving derro tried to become invisible to give itself a chance but Zodius made his eyes magic
						so he could see invisible creatures, foiling the derro's plan.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Everin</span> had been charging up until this point and unleashed his wrath on the 
						giant and slaying a death hound that had been attacking him for some time. Onnie chopped off one of the

						then launched this dog leg and magically accelerated it into the giant's body, killing the giant.

					<p class="Core">
						The semi-invisible derro flew around the ceiling hoping to somehow stop the barbarity of the invaders but was

						the last derro plummeted head-first toward the statue the cult had been focusing on but was struck by Everin, Zodius,
						and Galifraen and crumpled, dead, upon the floor. The group then ransacked the cultist's home and stealing some gold, silver,
						and crossbows. A book containing two rituals, one for enslaving lesser animals, and another for causing a creature to sprout 
						a second head and go mad was also recovered and translated by Zodius. With these items and nothing left to kill the party
						returned towards the exit of the <span class="location">Whorlstone Tunnels</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Before leaving Everin decided to murder the father-of-three derro that had been tied to the post and who had only recently
						had his hand sliced off by Seven-Stars. This accomplished Seven-Stars inisited on trying out the ritual on the cave bear that
						was spared when the group last past this way. After some inept animal handling the bear was positioned into the ritual center
						and after several hours and some psychic bullying by Zodius the bear'r mind was replaced with that of a resentful demon, "loyal"
						to Zodius. Just outside the exit of the tunnels Everin learned from <span class="npc">Pelek</span>, the deep-gnome ghost, that 
						the hand the group recovered is indeed his, but that to lay his ghost to rest the group will need to take all his remains to 
						<span class="location">Blingdenstone</span>, where his relatives will surely be thankful for his return. Everin grudgingly

						The derro was hesitent to speak but Seven-Stars loosened his tongue by loosing his hand from his

						The first impressions of the city are unfavorable, though the sanctuary it offers from the desolate blackness of the

						is somehow corrupting the minds of many of the duergar in the city and will reward evidence of corruption with gear from the
						duergar military's armory. She concludes by darkly mentioning that the adventurers should not attempt to leave the city without
						attending to Droki, implying that her "offer" is more of an ultimatum. Finally she gives each member of the party iron insignia
						bearing the mark of the Stone Gaurds (the military elite of Gracklstugh), which she says will grant them passage beyond the 
						Darklake District.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group decides to rest before heading to the West Cleft District and searching for Droki. During the evening several of them
						pass disguting black balls of tar-like flem and decide to purchase masks in the morning. While the rest of the group retires
						Shithead sets his heart on an orcish woman in the inn's common area but is attacked by a duergar slaver and decides to flee
						to the saftey of his room. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The following morning <span class="npc">Sareth</span> is too sick to leave bed, and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> demonstrates
						her deities favor by healing him of his coughing though the boils on his face continue to spread. The group travels to the 
						Blaze Bazaar and heads to area dominated by derro traders and buyers. Although coldy received the party asks about hiring 
						Droki through a contact named <span class="npc">Ylsa</span>, but when asked about Droki Ylsa claims ignorance, even when 
						presented with evidence that she does indeed know him. Disappointed in the lack of help, the group decides to head to 
						the West Cleft District and look for Droki there and as they leave a wretched derro begs Shithead for "summin ta' eat".
						It's request granted, the derro mutters that Droki wears a "floppy hat", before scurrying away into the bazaar.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Resuming their walk towards the West Cleft District, the group passes through one of the gates that border the Darklake District,
						and learn from the guards that Droki is a devious bastard. One of the guards also mentions abandoned guard towers that look into 
						the the West Cleft District and might provide a good vantage for watching the derro that come and go.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Beyond the gate of the Darklake the party find themselves in an even more bleak part of Gracklstugh, with even more forges and
						fumes than the Darklake District. They now make their way towards <span class="location">Laduguer's Furrow</span>, a great chasm
						in which many of the duergar live, the edges of which make up the east and west cleft districts.

					<h3>
						Session 9: Leemoogoogoon
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The frog-folk that approached last session indeed turn out to be friendly! They are lead by <span class="npc">Plooploopeen</span>,
						a frog-folk archpriest of a deity he refers to as "The Sea Mother". A slightly confused <span class="npc">Saren</span> 
						translates for group as Ploop explains to the group about his troubled village. Apparently his daughter has had
						visions which inspired her to oppose her father with the worship of a deity known as "The Deep Father". Ploop
						asked the group to accompany him back to the village as false prisoners, which he would offer to his daughter as
						sacrifices. Then he would attempt to kill her and her followers, with the help of the party. The group decided
						to accept in exchange for a guided passage across the <span class="location">Darklake</span> and towards 
						<span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>. 
					</p>	
					<p class="Core">
						Following the priest and his guards, the group is led into a vast cavern whose cheif feature is an
						immense lake. After trekking out onto an isthmus cutting across the lake and traveling for about an 
						hour the group finally arrives at the entrance to <span class="location">Sloobludop</span>. 
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> moves towards the lake's edge to fish but is dissuaded by the frog-folk
						who warn he may get pulled in.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The village is built across a portion of the isthmus and is protected by land with walls composed
						of tangled netting and hooks. Ploop escorts the party to his faction's area in the squalid village,
						with an unpleasant stature of a humanoid female carved of wood with a genuine crawfish head and
						claws strapped to it's figure with fishgut. Piled about its base are "offerings" mostly rotting 
						marine life. Inside his hut Ploop explains that he is going to parley with his daughter and offer
						you as sacrifices - he expects to return shortly. A heap of wealth temps <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						to theivery but the rope leashing him to the rest of the party stays his paws. Ploop returns with the 
						good news - you are to be sacrified!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Ploop and the group are escorted under guard to the "Altar of the Deep Father" where the opposing 
						priest is preparing for the sacrifice. 
						<span class="figure">
							<img src="Introduction2-web-resources/images/sloobludop/Altar.png" >
							Altar of the Deep Father
						</span>
						Three unconscious captives were  dragged in front of the altar and roused. A human, a duergar,
						and a halfing - or possibly goblin. Then the arhcpriestess orders her guards to prod the party towards
						these captives, she then utters a short prayer to the Deep Father.						
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Just before she signals for the sacrifice to begin, her father attacks her with his scepter - stunning her
						with the blow and signaling the party to strike! A few seconds of chaotic battle ensue before the priestess
						is slain with a blow to the head. Unfortunately the gore from her death christens the altar evoking an ominous
						roiling in the water of the lake. A terrible foe then bursts from the depths - a tentacle armed monstrosity with
						two <a href="importantnpcs.html#big_nasties">baboon</a> -like heads lumbers towards the village causing most of 
						the surviving frog-folk to panic, pray, or flee.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Witnessing such a horror manifested overcomes some of the adventures. Seven-Stars begins miming as though he were
						eating food. Shithead falls unconcious <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> takes the chance splattering of fishgut across his eyes as an
						act of providence, becoming much endeared to said fishguts. Feeling confident Galifraen aims a shot at the 
						massive creature hulking toward the village but somehow misses. This decides most of the party is a clear indication
						that it is time to flee. The frog-folk are too scattered and panicked to offer any resistance to the group stealing
						a large Kuo-Toan keelboat. The three captives who were to be sacrificed also manage to join the group although 
						Seven-Stars is nearly left behind to perish. As the group rows the alien craft away from the carnage a inadvertant
						tentacle lash from Leemoogoogoon knocks <span class="npc">Stool</span> overboard - but it is promptly rescued.
						Tragically the group realizes too that the <span class="pc">Moa</span> vanished during the conflict, and likely died
						in the frog-folk village.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Shortly after their escape the party gets aquainted with their new companions. <span class="pc">Francis</span> is
						a young adult human male with a warriors background - though he says little about himself, <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						is an ugly halfing, or plain-looking goblin, and <span class="npc">Helmeth</span> is a severe duergar with shifty
						eyes. After a brief discussion the group decides to travel to Gracklstugh, where they hope to finally aquire some 
						equipment worth of their talents.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Crossing the Darklake
					</h4>
					<p class="Core">
						With Gracklstugh as a destination the group starts rowing with gusto, breaking themselves into three 
						shifts of 2 rowers + a navigator. This means the oars are operated continously and cuts the journey
						of 10 days down to just 3! The group soon learns that the less time spent on the water, the better...
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Only a few hours into the first day a levitating 70 lb brain featuring a beak the size of an arm
						and stinging tenctacles decends silently down onto the boat and attempts to make a meal of Galifraen. 
						Failing in this the brain goes for Zodius and pulls him up and into the darkness above the sailing
						craft. Galifraen harpoons the beast with a rope-tethered crossbow bolt while most of the party 
						is forced to watch - having no way to attack a creature so far away. Zodious teleports away
						and Galifraen sends another bolt into the creature - killing it. Francis steers the vessel
						under the gently falling corpse and a bounty of meat is secured. <span class="pc">Oni</span>
						assures everyone that she can purify fouled food and drink and so the group has enough to 
						sustain them for the journey!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next two days are fraught with danger, with the first shift of rowers suffering the most. Several
						sentient manta ray attack the hull of the boat but give up a short time later. A voice calls out 
						for help while some of the taller members of the party knock their heads against a low overhang - Helmeth
						believes the voice to be that of one of the hags local to the Darklake area. A swarm of leathery mosquito
						like monsters buzz angrily about the parties heads during a rockfall - but soon pass on to a new home. 
						Perhaps most notably, four frog-folk happen within sight of the party and are pursued and subjected to 
						a cruel confiscation of most of their meagre equipment. Galifraen is noted for leaping onto the frog-folk's
						ship despite a spear hitting him mid-leap! Also notably is Shithead's conduct during the raid during which
						she recovered a muscle shell from among the bowels of one of the Kua-Toa - all of whom she "searched". Finally,
						the party wrestled with a gangly aquatic giant intent on draggin the boat into a whirlpool. When this failed 
						the giant attempted to board the boat by climbing up one side. Zodious was quite vocal about his plans to
						catapult the giant 50 feet into the air by leaping to one side of the boat but failed to convince his
						fellow adventurers. but was flung off by a powerful feat of strength by Francis. The effects of eating 
						nothing but brains for the last two days appear to have begun taking a toll on the groups mental state
						about this time as well as most of the party seemed more confused and boisterous than typical.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Shorly after the ordeal with the troll the party enters another of the great chambers of the Darklake area,
						and can dimly make out an orange smoldering light in the distance. Gracklstugh is within sight! Only an hour
						or so remains before they reach the city of the duergar! During this last stretch of rowing Galifraen
						has an abrupt change of heart regarding the fishguts, finding them suddenly abhorrent. He casts them into the water
						before washing his face, then seeks solitude in the hold of the boat. Jeering from Shithead makes this impossible
						and Galifraen decides instead to sulk at the edge of the boat, overcast by the twinkling smokey light of your next
						destination... Gracklstugh.

					<h3>
						Session 8: Narrow 'Scapes and Awed Frogs
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Whilst gathering the glowing crystals after <span class="npc">Grazzilax</span>'s departure, the group is 
						interrupted by several of their Drow pursuers. Chasing the drow down a passage, the party is at first
						triumphant, felling 3 of their 4 pursuers. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> even manages to collect 
						a scalp during the chase. Unfortunately the battle turns when the last surviving drow regroups with
						your former warden<a href="importantnpcs.html#jailers"> <span class="npc">Ilvara</span></a>!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Ilvara's ire is manifested in a swarm of infuriated maggot-wasps which mercilessly sting several of the 
						heroes, some to the point of unconciousness. <span class="pc">Moa</span> addresses the swarm with
						a lesson on good, evil, and agency - speculating that, as maggots, they posses bodies symbolic
						of metamorphosis, and that their actions now will doubtless determine the shape of their mature form. 
						This slightly calms the swarm so that they do not attack Moa, and do not impede movement. Moa uses
						this opportunity to drag the unconcious Galifraen out of the swarm. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> ensures Galifraen's immediate recovery with a portentious certainty
						that Galifraen will 'roll a 20 on his next death saving throw'. <span class="pc">Oni</span>	moves
						to attack Ilvara but, hearing god suggest she flee, decides to run instead. The rest of the group 
						decide to flee as well and a long chase through the underdark ensues.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						For 4 minutes the party runs like mad. Jagged stones, exploding mushrooms, steep ascents, giant flea migrations, 
						wasp-maggots bites, poisonous spores and a slippery streambed confound a clean escape. During the 5th minute
						several members of the group must pause for breath, and are relieved to find they have escaped their pursuers.
						Taking stock they learn that <span class="npc">Prince Derendil</span> and <span class="npc">Eldeth</span> 
						were lost during the flight. <span class="npc">Jorlan</span>, the drow guard who helped you escape, was among
						your pursuers, and cut Eldeth down.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a brief march to a safer locale, the party rests, and afterward decides to head to continue on to the 
						Kua-Toan village of <span class="location">Sloobludop</span>. The group plans to enter the village with 
						<span class="npc">Sareth</span> as a drow seeking passage, accompanied by Moa in the form of some undeground
						animal. However the group must still travel 2 days to reach the village and so they set out once more.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Their journey is impeded by a maze of webs, and also by a pair of Gricks which ambush the party. The gricks are 
						easily dispatched, though the moral justification for slaying them remains controvesal. Zodius firebolts a path
						through the webs and the group camps once more before making the final trek into Sloobludop.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group revises their plan, and decides to use the glowing stones they found, as well as some spore-caviar
						as offerings to the Kuo-Toans, in exchange for a guided passage accross the darklakes. An hour outside of town
						the group is threatened by several frog-folk who wish to sacrifice the adventurers to their 'Deep Father' deity.
						Oni attempts to awe the leader of the frogs with some magic and cool eyes but the effect is diminished by her 
						struggle with some netting over her head. The frog men attack, their leader felling Oni, and later <span class="pc">Everin</span>
						until Oni is healed at which point she rises up and smites the leader with an awesome blow which sends the whole
						group of frogs hopping into the darkness. Just as the party regroups and plans to rest another knot of Kua-Toa 
						approach, this time peacably and eager confer. What will come of this meeting of amphibian and adventurer?

					<h3>
						Session 7: Gracious Grazzilax
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						After fleeing into the labryrinthine tunnels south of their former prison,<span class="location">Velkynevelve</span>,
						the group takes a moment to decide on a course of travel. A brief discussion determines that the drow <span class="npc">
						Sareth</span> is the only being with sufficient knowledge of the underdark to navigate without a map. The closest
						areas know to the drow are described:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Darklakes (7 days) - A large region of the underdark characterized by numerous underground lakes linked by 
							submerged tunnels and waterways. Traveling here is faster than on foot, but requires a boat.</li>
						<li>Menzoberranzan (26 days) - Most powerful of the drow cities, going here would certainly result in recapture</li>
						<li>Gracklstugh (20 days) - Stronghold of duergar and derro, a dangerous place but secure from drow attack, shortest route
							lies across the darklakes </li>
						<li>Neverlight Grove (24 days) - Home of Stool, a cavern of friendly sentient fungi</li>
						<li>Sloobludop (8 days) - Village of frog-men, attitude toward outsiders varies</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Core">
						It is decided that the immediate destination be <span class="location">Sloobludop</span> as the drow and the frog-men
						are not generally on good terms and a ship for crossing the darklakes should be accessible. Sareth warns the group that
						the frog-men (or Kuo-Toa in their own tongue) are as likely to be friendly as they are to be hostile, depending on the 
						mood of the prevailing high preist. The group also learns that the village is comprised of about 500 Kuo-Toans and that
						<span class="npc">Shushaar</span>, one of the the unfortunate prisoners who did not escape with you, mentioned that 
						the priesthood in the village was divided. After aquiring a boat the group plans to cross a portion of the darklakes
						aiming for <span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With a clear destination the group resumes their journey, having left their prison without provisions the group must
						forage for food and water, which proves challenging in the alien undeground world. Without the familiar cycles of 
						night and day it is challenging to track time, and for now it is marked by the frequency of the group's need to rest.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first "day" of travel proves very unpleasant for <span class="npc">Sareth</span>,<span class="npc">Eldeth</span>, <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>, and 
						<span class="pc">Everin</span>. Maddening voices subvert and malign the traveler's psyche during this day and the aforementioned
						adventurures succumb to the lunatic whispers of the tunnel. Eldeth fled in a panic while Sareth crumpled into a histeric ball 
						on the stone floor. Galifraen stared into the space in front of his eye and Everin begin attacking everyone around him.
						Fortunately <span class="pc">Moa</span> determined that these afflictions would only persist for minutes, and those who had danced with madness
						soon recovered their wits. When asked if such unpleasantness was common in the underdark Sareth responded in the negative.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After an unpleasant rest in a damp chamber the group traveled another day, and found water and food for all.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next day is equally bleak with the added unpleasantness of an inadequate supply of food and water. While encamped the
						group encountered a pair of Kuo-Toan traders who offered an assortment of trinkets but were ultimately left without exchanging goods.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The fourth period of travel is uneventful, but hunger and thirst threaten to overwhelm the travelers. Several are quite exhausted 
						and are having trouble keeping pace. Near their campsite Everin and <span class="pc">Oni</span> spot a sinister fungi protruding 
						from the ceiling.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The fifth period of travel is dreadful at first, but late in the march a chamber spotted with growths of luminous 
						quartz is discovered, and in it a generous squid-headed creature. The creatue calls itself <span class="npc">Grazzilax</span>
						and offers the party aid in exchange for some "new data". Galifraen satifies the creature with a lecture on the sublties of 
						high elf blood relations. Grazzilax vanishes into the air, then reappears with water and food aplenty. He warns the group that
						the crystals in the chamber are explosive, a solid blow being sufficient to shatter them and release a flash of bright light.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Their growing thirst and hunger satisfied, and Sloobludop only 3 rest-cycles away, the groups fortunes seems brighter, especially
						under the warm glow of the quartz... 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session1">
					<h3>
						Session 6: Prisonbreak!
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						You awaken in a daze on cold stone floor of a slave pen deep underground. All of the
						group is present, as well as 10 other captives. All your possessions, except your
						clothes, have been taken. <span class="pc">Everin</span> speaks  undercommon and enables
						the rest of the group to converse with <a href="importantnpcs.html#session1Prisoners">the other prisoners</a> ,
						the most talkataive of which is <span class="npc">Jimjar</span>. The group learns that the wardens are drow who
						come three times every 24 hours (or every 48 pulses of one of the more prominent patches
						of flourescent fungi).They also tell the group that they arrived in a stupor and fell unconcious
						onto the floor for several hours before waking now.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Soon several drow arrive and take 2 of the group, along with 4 other prisoners out for hard labor.
						This happens 3 times before the adventurers are able to rest, with duties including shit-squeegeeing,
						rock breaking, rope coiling, rock piling, and bucket-lift operating. The upshot of this being that
						by the end of the third shift your group has a fair idea of the extents of the prison and its grounds.
						Most of the labor is uneventful, although <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> gets into trouble not lifting
						rocks with enough gusto and is clocked by a nearby Quaggoth. Galifraen feigns unconciousness in order to avoid
						further degrading himslef with rock piling.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A period of inactiivty follows the third shift of hard labor and gruel is brought to the cell. The party 
						considered their predicament and ask for a show of hands of those who would like to escape, all of the prisoners
						except the Dark Elf, <span class="npc">Sareth</span> indicate they wish to escape. Zodius and a egg-shaped sentient
						fungus become friends, and Stool creates a telepathic link between all of the prisoners. The Kuo-Toa yogi, <span class="npc">
						Shushaar</span>, breaks his silence and shares some gossip on one of the more important drow in the prison. According
						to Shushaar, a drow name <span class="npc">Jorlan</span> was recently disfigured in combat and has lost the favor of his
						lover, the commander of the prison, <span class="npc">Ilvara</span>, a drow high priestess. To make matters worse
						Ilvara has taken a new lover from among the drow at the prison further embittering Jorlan. Armed with this intel the 
						party plots to exploit Jorlans pain for their own benefit.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						During the next days hard labor <span class="pc">Moa</span> speaks with Jorlan, but is met with cold disinterest
						when she offers him the aid of the prisoners. Later Galifraen gets into trouble again, this by
						making indecent remarks concerning a neaby drow priestess to the guards. The guards decide to feed
						him to the giant spiders living in the webs below the prison but decide 4 bolts to the torso adequate punishment
						instead. Jorlan comes to the gate of the cell later and without prompting offers to leave the gate open
						for the party on the following day. The party agrees and eagerly await their escape.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a third day of menial labor Jorlan returns, and discreetly unlocks the gate while collecting the gruel
						bowls. He then leaves and Galifraen's keen eyes notice him leading away two of the guards in the chamber beyond 
						the slave pen. Everin and Seven-Stars sneak out and across the bridge, and botch an attempt to garrote the lone
						remaining guard. The rest of the group hustles across the narrow bridge and into the guardroom and quickly dispatch 
						him silently. In hurried movements the group arm themselves with crossbows and swords, some choosing armor 
						as well. Ront cleaves the silk bridge that connects the slave pen and guard house which alerts the guards and
						a battle ensues!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Galifraen is the first to leap into the spiderwebs below, with Zodius hanging onto his tunic. The land and
						are stuck, with 4 giant spiders approaching and drow shooting down at them with crossbows. The ensuing seconds 
						are a chaos of fighting and desparate wriggling in the webs. Shuushar is dragged away by spiders and Ront is 
						felled by arrows. Quaggoths demonstate their ability to climb cliff faces and close in. Zodius, Oni, Everin and 
						Moa escape the webs and leap into the water below. Stool, Eldeth, Sareth and Derendil also escape. Those remaining
						find themselves pressed by the quaggoth, drow and spiders. Galifraen narrowly avoids recapture in the webs and 
						leaps into the pool as well.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Below on the cavern floor, pursued by quaggoth, the party escape through a passage into a maze of tunnels. For now 
						they have escaped the drow, but they will need food and water soon... hunger may yet prove a crueler master than 
						any drow.

						Session 5: The Wyvern's Tale
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						A new day dawns in <span class="location">Ashabenford</span> and two
						new adventurers enter town with the dawn. <span class="pc">Lilly-Warrior</span>
						awakens in an alley recovering from a concussion suffered in
						an unremembered past. She overhears Galifraen, Everin, and Oni
						discussing matters outside <span class="location">The White Hart Inn</span>
						before going inside. Down the lane, another newcomer, <span id="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						also hears the conversations and is drawn to to signet rings the two
						speakers are wearing.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Everin and Oni play at dice and drink inside the Inn while 
						Galifraen broods. Seven-Stars enters the inn and while the 
						stable boy/barkeep <span class="npc">Barnaby</span> leaves
						SS borrows a fancy mug from behind the bar and pours himself
						a drink, then sits down next to Galifraen, disturbing the high-elf.
						Oni helps Lilly-Warrior with her head injury before the innkeep 
						returns and, perceiving SS's ruse about Galifraen drinking from 
						the mug, kick SS out of the bar. The innkeep then describes
						a ranger, known as <span class="npc">Zoloft</span> who may
						be able to help the group find drow and wyverns in the forest.
						Zoloft conveniently appears and offers his services in aquiring
						wyvern stingers, explaining that the mage <span class="npc">Noristuor</span>
						has hired him to help. The group enlists the aid of SS and Lilly-Warrior
						before leaving town with in their Wagon, with Moa in horse form pulling.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first day's travel takes you out of town north along the 
						road called the 'Moonsea Ride'. You pass through many farms
						and fields. It being late autumn there are numerous squash and
						grains growing in the fields. By nightfall you have left the main
						road and traveled to the edge of the forest which Zoloft calls 
						'The Rimwood'. Before bedding down for the night you are attacked
						by two owl-bears which you quickly dispatch. Lilly-Warrior, who
						was concerned about not having enough to eat makes use of the bear
						meat.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next day takes you through the Rimwood, which is sparesly
						populated with pines and low shrubs. Insects and numerous 
						and by nightfall Zoloft admits he is lost but assures you tomorrow
						will find you a wyvern. Before bedding down Moa holds an audience
						with the local ants and drives them off with bad-vibes, in exchange
						for a wasp sting.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The third day brings you into the 'Midwood', which is cooler, more
						humid, and more crowded with trees. Oak and maple are common and small
						mammals are common. By evening Zoloft has found a wyvern lair by a creek
						and he explains that you are in a area of the forest where animal diets
						are inverted - so the wyvern should be herbiverous and therfore less
						challenging to slay. You prepare a snare trap and await the beast, rubbing
						yourselves in red maple to mask your scent from it.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The wyvern arrives and is fooled by a spread of fruit illusioned by 
						Zodius. The trap works as well and your group lays into the beast, 
						slaying it without too much trouble. Unfortunately strange magic
						and a drow ambush immediately follow your victory and in less than
						a minute your entire group, except possibly Zoloft, have succumbed
						to the ambush.

					Below are the session synopses which took place during our

					<h3>
						Session 4
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						You and your fellows dosed on the purple powder and entered
						a dream realm much like the mansion. A satyr-like man attacked
						and you managed to slay him, though some of you suffered very
						bad dreams following the encounter. With his defeat you went
						outside and collected the last of the 4 shards which you then
						took into the cellar.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The demon Donamoth appeared in the fog surrounding his lair
						and boasted before vanishing. After some attempts at entering
						the fog while holding the shards one slipped out of hand and
						into the barrier, seemingly weakening it. You let go the remaining
						shards and the barrier fell, revealing a circular chamber covered
						over with diabolic runes where Donamoth waited.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a brief dialog your group attacked the demon and managed
						to dispatch the brute without much trouble. Though he left behind
						nothing Galifraen examined a sarcophagus in the chamber and learned
						it contained the remains of a ward who died, along with six others,
						to bind some great evil. You went outside and found that the 
						mansion was no longer trapped within the impenetrable fog... you
						were free! Before leaving you investigated the chest upstairs and
						found a dandy, calling himself
						<span class="npcName">
							Dbard
						</span>
						inside. He promised to write of your exploits and pay you half his 
						earnings for one nights performance if you spared  him.
					</p>

					<h3>
						Session 3
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Before settling into a short rest your previously vanquished
						foe rose up from the floor and landed one last blow before
						expiring. Your rest completed, you continued to explore the
						second floor of the mansion and encountered the demonic face
						of your host who took control of a stuffed wolf-man and
						attacked you! Then you smashed the jade figurine you obtained
						earlier to see what was inside, you found jade dust. Shortly
						after a toy room with a malicious leprechaun doll also attacked
						you. You managed to destroy both but were in need of rest so
						returned downstairs and barricaded yourselves with REW RA in
						the dining room. Your rest was interrupted by two unfortunate
						Red Listens who you quickly slew before completing your 
						long naps.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Refreshed you continue to explore and in the cellar and found
						an ancient sword in a passage behind some wine casks. You also
						had a brief interview with the host who appeared on the surface
						of a seemingly impenetrable barrier of fog. The head made clear
						it wants you dead... but you already knew that. Traveling back
						outside you found that the 4 statues in the garden had transformed
						and that each appear to represent a powerful servant of Donamoth, 
						two of the statues had crumbled revealing a purple fist-sized shard
						within which you took. You then found Torgo in some bushes and 
						learned that one of the powerful being represented by the statues,
						"Kruugar the dream sage", was only to be found within
						your heads - and that he came only while you slept. You decided
						to go to the greenhouse first and there slew a plant-elf horror
						without much trouble.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Returning to the house you investigated what you believe to 
						be the only remaining rooms downstairs and slew several more
						Red Listen cultists who had barricaded themselves in an attempt 
						to escape your wrath. While completing your sweep of the downstairs
						you passed through a library where a decapitated cultist lay. You
						took the book he was reading and two other books bound similarly
						as well as a text on alchemical reagents. With the mansion
						apparently cleared of foes (except for the host trapped in the 
						cellar) you gathered in the parlor and discussed attempting to
						sleep as a means of encountering Kruugar.

					<h3>
						Session 2
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The host arrived and asked you all to play a guessing game. He was a middle-aged human with a large mustache and a red face and his likeness appeared on the staues in the courtyard, leading you to believe he was Quincy. However he appears to be some kind of monster who inhabited Quincy's body! You learned all this when he ambushed your group with animated chairs and murdered Brunor. After you smashed the chairs and slew the insane serving maid the head of a demon appeared in the fireplace and "ate" Brunor's soul. It then swore to eat your souls as well before vanishing in the flames.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Your group left the dining area
						and began to to explore the mansion, except for REW RA who slept
						soundly on the dining table. Soon you ran into Torgo again, who was
						being bullied by a scrawny youth with a pimply face in a large
						red-cowled robe. You slew the youth with a single arrow as he
						turned to attack you and asked Torgo about what was going on. Torgo
						took a long time to explain but the gist was that:
					</p>
					<ul class="Chapter_CORE-BULLETED">
						<li>
							A group calling itself the "Red Listens", wearing red robes believe that an army of extra-planar creatures will dominate this world soon.
						</li>
						<li>
							10 days ago the leaders of the group were instructed to come to the mansion to free one said extra-planar creatures
						</li>
						<li>
							The cultists came and slew everyone in the mansion
						</li>
						<li>
							In the cellar a coffin was opened by the group and the entity within in possessed the body of the manison's owner.
						</li>
						<li>
							This owner, who Torgo called "The Master", then altered the 4 chief members of the Red Listens in some way to make them more powerful.
						</li>
						<li>
							One was made strong (Torgo's Uncle), another was made small, the third vanished when he slept and now walks in dreams, and the fourth died during the process.
						</li>
						<li>
							When the third died one of the guests at the mansions before the attack was found hiding in the green house and was changed "into a bush er--- planted".
						</li>
						<li>
							Some "ancient things" (valuables) are upstairs
						</li>
						<li>
							Torgo wants to leave and is hiding outside among the hedges in the courtyard for now.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Core">
						After Galifraen aquired some archaic but functional chainmail you traveled upstairs in search of valuables. Passing by an enchanted suit of armor that strikes out with it's halbered at anyone who gets close, you slew 2 sleeping cultists and tricked a third, and rather vain cultist who you then killed. On him you found some strange purple powder which induces a deep sleep on anyone who comes into contact with it. Later you found a shit-covered lavatory, and looked out over a large balcony to discover that the world outside was somehow cut-off by a great amber-red cloud of fog. Attempting to pass through the fog with Horace the owl proved unfruitful - some kind of spacial distortion prevent travel much beyond 80' of the mansion roof, and probably halts travel beyond or to the gate. You also found a trunk in a room which held some frightened creature but you decided not to attempt to open the chest by force and instead locked it.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back inside you found two more cultists looking for a hand like object in a room of curios, along with a brute of a man who stood by silently. One of you passes himself off as a cultist again and stabbed the large man, but was brutally repaid with a blow which knocked him unconcious. A unpleasant fight ensued but your group emerged victorious, though wounded.

					<h3>
						Session 1
					</h3>
					<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
						Most of you received an unusual letter in the mail which read:
						<br>
					</p>
					<p class="quote" style="text-indent:0px">
						Dear friend,
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						I, Jerfort Qunicy Wutherton III, cordially invite you to attend supper at my country home in Mistledale. You may have heard of me from my exploits abroad.
								I am enclosing 10 sovereigns in the hope that you will find them sufficient cause to attend the meeting I have planned.
								Arrangments have been made at the White Hart Inn in Ashabenford for your reception should you arrive early.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
						Please do come, I am not a spiritual man but have had strange dreams of late, and believe our fates are somehow intertwined.
								I feel I somehow owe you a debt, and hope meeting with you personally will jog my memory... The innkeep at the White Stag 
								will have instructions for you once you arrive.
						<br>
						Your friend,
						<br>
						Quincy
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						You decided to head to The White Stag, and met several other adventurers who had received similiar letters, save for Ottie, who had seen all of the letter-holders in a dream.
						After some discussion you decided to travel with these adventurers
						to the Manor and asked around the tavern for information on Quincy. You learned that he was well respected as an explorer and collector of exotic relics. A while later rustic 
						coach arrived (more of a straw wagon) and took you out of town on a 2-hour journey along the forest's edge. At some point on the ride a wolf print was found, as well as some
						light shining from among the trees in the distance. Your driver was friendly, though he knew little of Quincy.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arriving at the gates of the mansion you observed a roughly 200-year-old building, fit for a noble. You proceeded into the courtyard and noted several statues
						with plaques depicting Quincy in various heroic poses in exotic lands. Knocking at the front door you met Torgo, the awkward butler of the estate. Torgo led you
						into the dining room where you met another guest who called himself "Brunor". Torgo poured drinks while Brunor asked you about yourselves, and you learned that Brunor
						had received a letter similiar to yours and that he is a grain merchant. Rew ate some of the bread and fell into a deep sleep while the rest of you spoke with each other
						and waited for the host to arrive.
