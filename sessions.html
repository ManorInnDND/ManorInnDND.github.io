				Below are the session synopses which took place during our
				first adventure, "The Spoooooky Mansion".

				<p class="Chapter_SECTION-HEADER-1">Session 4</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					You and your fellows dosed on the purple powder and entered
					a dream realm much like the mansion. A satyr-like man attacked
					and you managed to slay him, though some of you suffered very
					bad dreams following the encounter. With his defeat you went
					outside and collected the last of the 4 shards which you then
					took into the cellar.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					The demon Donamoth appeared in the fog surrounding his lair
					and boasted before vanishing. After some attempts at entering
					the fog while holding the shards one slipped out of hand and
					into the barrier, seemingly weakening it. You let go the remaining
					shards and the barrier fell, revealing a circular chamber covered
					over with diabolic runes where Donamoth waited.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					After a brief dialog your group attacked the demon and managed
					to dispatch the brute without much trouble. Though he left behind
					nothing Galifraen examined a sarcophagus in the chamber and learned
					it contained the remains of a ward who died, along with six others,
					to bind some great evil. You went outside and found that the 
					mansion was no longer trapped within the impenetrable fog... you
					were free! Before leaving you investigated the chest upstairs and
					found a dandy, calling himself <span class="npcName">Dbard</span>
					inside. He promised to write of your exploits and pay you half his 
					earnings for one nights performance if you spared  him.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_SECTION-HEADER-2">
					Back in Town
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					You traveled back to Ashabenford, collecting Torgo, the awkward
					butler from the mansion, on your way. Moa spent the night stealing
					a horse from <span class="location">Kaulvaeras Stables</span> and the
					follwing morning looking for healing potion ingredients. She found
					catstongue.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Galifraen traveled to the home of the town Magistrate, 
					a human male named <span class="npc">Haresk Malorn</span> who 
					was preoccupied with taking notes and saying &quot;yes&quot; at
					odd intervals. Haresk directed Galifraen to see <span class="npc">Goliaoh</span>
					who offered a reward of 3 gp for drow heads and more if the party
					could determine the source of the drow attacks on the town.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Everin met with an innkeep and arms dealer at <span class="location">The 
					Ashabenford Arms</span> and bartered for a shortsword and studded leather armor.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Onnie sold a jester cap to <span class="npc">Markov</span> a middle-aged
					human female who ran the general store. Onnie then went to <span class="location">
					Multhimmer's Trading Post</span> and sold the voodoo doll and monkey paw. She then
					went to the potion shop owned by <span class="npc">Almaes</span>, an old
					gnome female and purchased two healing potions.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Zodius visited the town's resident reclusive wizard, <span class="npc">Noristuor</span>
					who was rude and dismissive but offered to buy 3 wyvern stingers for 200 gp if
					Zodius could get them from some of the beasts living in the caves to the north of
					town. Zodius also visted Almaes and purchased a lesser healing potion.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					You then gathered outside of town and are thinking of hiring a guide to seek out
					the wyverns to collect their stingers. After which you will seek out the source of
					the drow.

				<p class="Chapter_SECTION-HEADER-1">Session 3</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Before settling into a short rest your previously vanquished
					foe rose up from the floor and landed one last blow before
					expiring. Your rest completed, you continued to explore the
					second floor of the mansion and encountered the demonic face
					of your host who took control of a stuffed wolf-man and
					attacked you! Then you smashed the jade figurine you obtained
					earlier to see what was inside, you found jade dust. Shortly
					after a toy room with a malicious leprechaun doll also attacked
					you. You managed to destroy both but were in need of rest so
					returned downstairs and barricaded yourselves with REW RA in
					the dining room. Your rest was interrupted by two unfortunate
					Red Listens who you quickly slew before completing your 
					long naps.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Refreshed you continue to explore and in the cellar and found
					an ancient sword in a passage behind some wine casks. You also
					had a brief interview with the host who appeared on the surface
					of a seemingly impenetrable barrier of fog. The head made clear
					it wants you dead... but you already knew that. Traveling back
					outside you found that the 4 statues in the garden had transformed
					and that each appear to represent a powerful servant of Donamoth, 
					two of the statues had crumbled revealing a purple fist-sized shard
					within which you took. You then found Torgo in some bushes and 
					learned that one of the powerful being represented by the statues,
					&quot;Kruugar the dream sage&quot;, was only to be found within
					your heads - and that he came only while you slept. You decided
					to go to the greenhouse first and there slew a plant-elf horror
					without much trouble.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">	
					Returning to the house you investigated what you believe to 
					be the only remaining rooms downstairs and slew several more
					Red Listen cultists who had barricaded themselves in an attempt 
					to escape your wrath. While completing your sweep of the downstairs
					you passed through a library where a decapitated cultist lay. You
					took the book he was reading and two other books bound similarly
					as well as a text on alchemical reagents. With the mansion
					apparently cleared of foes (except for the host trapped in the 
					cellar) you gathered in the parlor and discussed attempting to
					sleep as a means of encountering Kruugar.

				<p class="Chapter_SECTION-HEADER-1">Session 2</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">The host arrived and asked you all to play a guessing game. He was a middle-aged human with a large mustache and a red face and his likeness appeared on the staues in the courtyard, leading you to believe he was Quincy. However he appears to be some kind of monster who inhabited Quincy's body! You learned all this when he ambushed your group with animated chairs and murdered Brunor. After you smashed the chairs and slew the insane serving maid the head of a demon appeared in the fireplace and &quot;ate&quot; Brunor's soul. It then swore to eat your souls as well before vanishing in the flames. </p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Your group left the dining area
					and began to to explore the mansion, except for REW RA who slept
					soundly on the dining table. Soon you ran into Torgo again, who was
					being bullied by a scrawny youth with a pimply face in a large
					red-cowled robe. You slew the youth with a single arrow as he
					turned to attack you and asked Torgo about what was going on. Torgo
					took a long time to explain but the gist was that:
				</p>
				<ul class="Chapter_CORE-BULLETED">
				  <li>A group calling itself the &quot;Red Listens&quot;, wearing red robes believe that an army of extra-planar creatures will dominate this world soon.   </li>     
				  <li>10 days ago the leaders of the group were instructed to come to the mansion to free one said extra-planar creatures</li>
				  <li>The cultists came and slew everyone in the mansion     </li>
				  <li> In the cellar a coffin was opened by the group and the entity within in possessed the body of the manison's owner.</li>
				  <li> This owner, who Torgo called &quot;The Master&quot;, then altered the 4 chief members of the Red Listens in some way to make them more powerful.</li>
				  <li> One was made strong (Torgo's Uncle), another was made small, the third vanished when he slept and now walks in dreams, and the fourth died during the process. </li>       
				  <li> When the third died one of the guests at the mansions before the attack was found hiding in the green house and was changed &quot;into a bush er--- planted&quot;.</li>                 
				  <li>Some &quot;ancient things&quot; (valuables) are upstairs  </li>
				  <li>Torgo wants to leave and is hiding outside among the hedges in the courtyard for now.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">After Galifraen aquired some archaic but functional chainmail you traveled upstairs in search of valuables. Passing by an enchanted suit of armor that strikes out with it's halbered at anyone who gets close, you slew 2 sleeping cultists and tricked a third, and rather vain cultist who you then killed. On him you found some strange purple powder which induces a deep sleep on anyone who comes into contact with it. Later you found a shit-covered lavatory, and looked out over a large balcony to discover that the world outside was somehow cut-off by a great amber-red cloud of fog. Attempting to pass through the fog with Horace the owl proved unfruitful - some kind of spacial distortion prevent travel much beyond 80' of the mansion roof, and probably halts travel beyond or to the gate. You also found a trunk in a room which held some frightened creature but you decided not to attempt to open the chest by force and instead locked it.</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">Back inside you found two more cultists looking for a hand like object in a room of curios, along with a brute of a man who stood by silently. One of you passes himself off as a cultist again and stabbed the large man, but was brutally repaid with a blow which knocked him unconcious. A unpleasant fight ensued but your group emerged victorious, though wounded.</p>

					Most of you received an unusual letter in the mail which read:<br></p>
					<p class="quote" style=text-indent:0px> Dear friend, </p>
					<p class="quote">
							I, Jerfort Qunicy Wutherton III, cordially invite you to attend supper at my country home in Mistledale. You may have heard of me from my exploits abroad.
							I am enclosing 10 sovereigns in the hope that you will find them sufficient cause to attend the meeting I have planned.
							Arrangments have been made at the White Hart Inn in Ashabenford for your reception should you arrive early.
					</p>
					<p class="quote">
							Please do come, I am not a spiritual man but have had strange dreams of late, and believe our fates are somehow intertwined.
							I feel I somehow owe you a debt, and hope meeting with you personally will jog my memory... The innkeep at the White Stag 
							will have instructions for you once you arrive.
						<br>Your friend,
						<br>Quincy
					</p>
					
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					You decided to head to The White Stag, and met several other adventurers who had received similiar letters, save for Ottie, who had seen all of the letter-holders in a dream.
					After some discussion you decided to travel with these adventurers
					to the Manor and asked around the tavern for information on Quincy. You learned that he was well respected as an explorer and collector of exotic relics. A while later rustic 
					coach arrived (more of a straw wagon) and took you out of town on a 2-hour journey along the forest's edge. At some point on the ride a wolf print was found, as well as some
					light shining from among the trees in the distance. Your driver was friendly, though he knew little of Quincy.
				</p>
				<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">
					Arriving at the gates of the mansion you observed a roughly 200-year-old building, fit for a noble. You proceeded into the courtyard and noted several statues
					with plaques depicting Quincy in various heroic poses in exotic lands. Knocking at the front door you met Torgo, the awkward butler of the estate. Torgo led you
					into the dining room where you met another guest who called himself "Brunor". Torgo poured drinks while Brunor asked you about yourselves, and you learned that Brunor
					had received a letter similiar to yours and that he is a grain merchant. Rew ate some of the bread and fell into a deep sleep while the rest of you spoke with each other
					and waited for the host to arrive.
