					Below are the sessions following our campaign based on the <em>Out of the Abyss</em> 
					campaign setting.

				<section id="session66">
					<h3>Session 66: Journey to Araj I</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party heads out to the entry level of <span class="location">Gravenhollow</span> and find that 
						<span class="npc">Vizeran</span> has left a map for them to get to his tower. They also find an echo of the famed 
						wizard <span class="npc">Elminster</span>, who hints at knowing the party from some time in the future. <span class="pc">Seven-Moons</span>
						has resurfaced in the psyche of Seven-Stars, and the party decides the visions were a bit rough on him but are  unable 
						to help him. They figure it's not a big enough deal to detour for.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Leaving they use the magic of Gravenhollow to arrive within a tenday of Araj. On the way they encounter a drow patrol and attack, slaying 
						the warriors and capturing the wizard. A gruesome interrogation follows, with drow scalping added for emphasis. During the interrogation
						the party learns that the wizard is from the city of <span class="npc">Menzoberranzan</span>, has a daughter, and that he is seeking 
						a purple worm egg as a gift for his house matron, <span class="npc">Mez'Barris Armgo</span>. His answers are believed as <span class="pc">Onnie</span>
						cast <i>Zone of Truth</i> on him. Irritated by the wizard's disbelief that Lloth was behind the demon invasion, <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> asks
						"How many slaves have you sacrificed to Lloth". The wizard suposes somewhere around 20, and is scalped as he answers. Despite the pain the wizard 
						remains concious, and curses the party as his throat is slit.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang continues on their way to Araj...
					</p>

					<h3>Session 65: Gravenhollow II</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party wakes to a new day in Gravenhollow and decide to seek out <span class="npc">Ulthar</span> and 
						get a <span class="item">Stonespeaker Crystal</span>. <span class="pc">Francis</span> is revealed as the wisest of the 
						party, and is chosen to be their focus in finding Ulthar. Along the way they encounter an aged echo of <span class="npc">King Bruenor</span>
						of Mithril Hall, but he is incoherant in his dotage and unable to offer any information. Ulthar is in his chambers 
						and stoically offers <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> a Stonespeaker Crystal in reward for the 
						information he provided to Urmas.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Next the party seeks <span class="npc">Vizeran</span>, and find him studying. He greets <span class="pc">Francis</span> and 
						introduces himself as former archmage of <span class="location">Menzoberranzan</span>, and is pleased to hear 
						the party is interested in working with him against the demon invaders.<span class="figure"><img src="media/images/sevenwizards.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="seven-stars wizard">"Seven-Wizards"</span> Seven-Stars has disguised himself as a wizard, irritating 
						Zodius, who learned from Francis that Vizeran was eager to speak with a wizard in the party. Vizeran appears to believe both 
						Zodius and Seven-Stars to be wizards and mainly addresses them in his speaking. He suggests the party meet him when they 
						are ready to leave Gravenhollow, and travel with him to his tower, <span class="location">Araj</span>, where he 
						can describe his plan out of 'earshot' of Gravenhollow. He also suggests the party gather information using their 
						Stonespeaker Crystal and supplement the vision he has had. A vision he then recreates through powerful illusion magic.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The image of a imperious drow male mage appears, surrounded by arcane sigils and protective wards on the floor. Vizeran
						curses this drow over the illusion, naming him <span class="npc">Gromphe Baenre</span>, a mongrel supplicant of the bitch and 
						deceiver <span class="npc">Lloth</span>. Gromphe gestures and incants, casting some sort of powerful spell. 
						A surge of purple energy disrupts many of the sigils, destabilizing the ritual and Gromphe struggles, attempting to 
						regain control of the runaway magics. Vizeran interrupts again, cursing Gromphe's imbecile attempt at summoning in a
						faezzrus (wild-magic) suffused zone. Gromphe loses all control as unstable abysall tears open across the Underdark, allowing 
						demon lords to enter. <span class="pc">Shithead</span> admonishes Vizeran for his foul language, reciprocating Vizeran's 
						earlier criticism of Shithead's language.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After the meeting with Vizeran the gang heads to an orbed-out room of Zodius' finding to relax and experience visions. On 
						their way they encounter the echo of a younger <span class="npc">Hgramm</span>, leader of the stone giants living in <span class="location">Graklstugh</span>,
						who is pleased to hear that he becomes leader of the giants there (he is currently studying to become such). Someone in the party offends 
						him and he leaves. <span class="pc">Everin</span> wonders how it is that Hgramm did not seem to remember this encounter with the 
						adventures when they met him in Gracklstugh.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arriving in the orb room the party settles in and Seven-Stars begins asking questions of the crystal.
					</p>
					<h4>The Visions of Seven-Stars</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Who sent Sladis to attack us?</strong><br>
							Sladis, the elf who was met outside Mantol Derith appears, he is at a meeting 
							of the Emerald Enclave, a druid collective. He enters the Underdark with 2 companions, 
							eventually reaching the pink fog of Zuggtmoy's mushroom. He goes mad in the pink mists, 
							emerging from them in animal form, the arm of one of his companions in his puma mouth. 
							He degenerates in the caves of the underdark, wandering to the Darklake and swimming 
							to Mantol-Derith, where he finds many different races to prey on and expand his twisted 
							palate. He sees the party and notes Seven-Stars as an exotic delicacy...
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>What happens with Vizeran?</strong><br>
							The party travels to a Stalagmite tower, and enter, Zodius stops and steals a 
							purple gem, exchanging it for a common stone. Vizeran presents an obscure plan 
							involving collecting several items. Galifraen meets with Vizeran's apprentice 
							and agrees to betray Vizeran to help the apprentice. The party returns after 
							much work with the items, Seven-Stars loses focus and whether the party 
							follow through with their betrayal remains unclear.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Where can we get some loot?</strong><br>
							A dragons horde with gold and dwarven artifacts appears most interesting to 
							Seven-Stars, passing up on obscure items for Vizeran's quest and a shortsword 
							desired by Shithead. Atop the horde an idiot blue dragon stares vacantly. Served by 
							a legion of blue-skinned Kobolds. An enscription over an arch appears in the ruined
							hall 'Karag-a-Karak', the name of a Dwarven hold of antiquity.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Which demon lords are here?</strong><br>
							Eight demons are uncerimoniously wrenched through 8 portals wide apart in the Underdark. Dim 
							impressions flicker across Seven-Stars mind...
							<ol>
								<li>Demongorgon - Prince of demons, two baboon heads and tentacle arms.</li>
								<li>Baphomet - King of minotaurs and savage beasts, a skull headed mintoaur.</li>
								<li>Graz'zt - Beautiful humanoid, shifting into a Tabaxi, best not to look to long.</li>
								<li>Jubilex - Ooze god, the faceless lord, the ever-hungry.</li>
								<li>Orcus - Prince of Undeath, rotting goat head and legs, obese rotting man body.</li>
								<li>Yeenoghu - The Gnoll Lord, a mighty gnoll with a triple-headed flail.</li>
								<li>Zuggtmoy - Queen of Rot, a vaguely feminine fungal mass.</li>
								<li>Fraz-Urb'luu - Prince of Deception, great gargoyle with every face. Hardest to ignore for Seven-Stars.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Whereabouts of any demon lord except many face?</strong><br>
							Demogorgon rises out of the Darklake, his twin heads oddly quivering. They merge and become 
							one head, with every face flashing across it. Seven-Moons falls into the left pupil of this 
							terrible mask and after a time in darkness tumbles out of a dark gem. A duergar stoops and picks up 
							the gem, taking it to a deep gnome for appraisal. The gnome refuses to return the gem, giving it 
							to an apprentice. The apprentice skulks away, and is ambushed by a gargoyle. The gargoyle snatches 
							the gem, flies away, and gives the gem to a female drow. The drow prepares her poisoned dagger, meets 
							with Zhentarim agents and stabs one. A nearby tent collapses as the party rush out and attack, killing 
							the drow. Zodius reaches down and carfully picks up the gem with a glove. Zodius gives the gem 
							to another duergar who is slain when attempting to give a false gem to the first duergar that picked 
							the gem up. This is Krimgol, leader of the duergar enclave in Mantol-Derith. Krimgol prepares to 
							leave Mantol-Derith, presumably heading to Gracklstugh with the gem always in his hand.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Core">
						These visions take place over several days, during which a <span class="npc">Red Wizard of Thay</span>
						pokes his bald head into the chamber but quickly leaves, dismissing the party as mere echoes. Seven-Stars
						wants no more visions and the party prepares to leave Gravenhollow and travel with Vizeran to his tower.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session64">
					<h3>Session 64: Gravenhollow I</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The doors into Gravenhollow open, the the adventurers enter a hall wide enough for 
						ten to walk abreast. The hall opens into a large circular hamber, lit overhead 
						by thousands of light-infused crystals and flanked by countless doors. Innumerable 
						levels can be seen below from a wide well in the center of the chamber. A 
						Galeb-Dur manifests out of a nearby wall and suggests the adventurers head to their chambers
						before exploring the library.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A few decide to rest after acquiring a splitting heading attempting to decide where to go
						in the library. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>, <span class="pc">Francis</span>, and
						<span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> decide to seek answers in the library after 
						the gang espies an Illithid named Xetzirbor. Xetzibor asserts that the other mind 
						flayer the gang has met, one named <span class="npc">Grazzilax</span>, is also in the 
						library. It also suggests that information may be found by 'thinking on it', ie by 
						force of will. This is what causes several of the gang to get headaches and the 
						three aformentioned heroes to stike out into the halls looking for answers.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Galifraen seeks an answer to 'who/what are directing the forces of chaos'. He ends up 
						in a room dedicated to current event, where a partially carved relief depicts turmoil 
						in a increasingly unstable <span class="location">Gracklstugh</span> as well as 
						a less detailed but similarly precarious situation in the drow city of <span class="location">Menzoberranzan</span>.
						The room contains tablets describing events in both cities, with Gracklstugh suffering 
						civil war between the keepers of the flame and the grey ghosts amidst increasingly 
						powerful derro cults and Menzoberranzan's powerful families recklessly vying for power.
						Galifraen deems this chamber out-of-context with his question and puzzles over what 
						it could mean. 
					<p class="Core">
						Meanwhile, Seven-Stars maintains yogic-like focus on the question 'Why Us', and 
						encounters one of the three Librarians of Gravenhollow, a stone giant male named 
						<span class="npc">Urmas</span>, keeper of the present. Urmas is busy carving 
						a relief when Seven-Stars enters and can only offer a determinisic answer to 
						Seven-Stars query. Urmas posits that 'Why Us' is a futile question because 
						events have occured in a pattern that has brought them here. It is more that 
						the adventurers <i>happen</i> to be the surface dream's answer to the threat 
						of the demons than that they were <i>chosen</i> too. He suggests that if they 
						wish keep their delusion of fate intact they can meet with his sister, the keeper 
						of the future who is another stone giant names <span class="npc">Ustova</span>.
						Seven-Stars offers Urmas all the information he has on the demons, which 
						the librarian warms to, and after which he suggests Seven-Stars seek out the keeper 
						of the Past, <span class="npc">Ulthar</span>, who can offer him a <span class="item">Stonespeaker Crystal</span>
						which can be used to experience visions within the walls of Gravenhollow.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						While this is happening so to is Francis seeking an answer, to 'What must be done to stop the demons'.
						He encounters an elderly drow wizard and two toad-like monsters in a chamber dedicated to the future. 
						The drow introduces himself as <span class="npc">Vizeran</span>, with bodyguards <span class="npc">Kleeve</span> and 
						<span class="npc">Greeve</span>. Vizen is surprised to find a surface dweller in the library, and a 
						'real one' at that. He explains that most of the visitors in the library are phantoms or 'echoes' that 
						have visted, or are yet to visit the library. He believes that Francis and he are meeting each 
						other for a reason, and when he learns that demon fighting is the cause of Francis' vist he 
						confides that he too is seeking a way to defeat the abyssal terrors, and that the archmage of Menzoberranzan, 
						<span class="npc">Gromph Baenre</span>, is implicated in the invasion. He curses <span class="npc">Llolth</span> before 
						leaving Francis, suggesting that they find each other in no more than two days time. During the conversation 
						the mage displays an awkward understanding of surface customs like handshakes. His toad bodyguards speak little 
						during the conversation, instead constantly bobbing their throats in a rhythmic beat.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						What answers await the gang in the library...

					<h3>Session 63: Sleepwalking and Arrival at Gravenhollow</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party watches as the tentacle rises out of the pool, it's tip capped with a 
						venus flytrap-like appendage that opens and begins emitting sound. <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						takes this a cue to move farther away while the rest of the gang watches. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>
						determines that the sounds are words, spoken in the tongue of the Kua-Toan peoples, though no one 
						is able to understand (despite a valiant effort by <span class="pc">Evernin</span>).
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a minute or so the tentacle recedes into the water and the party moves on, taking a  
						long rest. Galifraen, Zodious, and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> heal from their fly bites, 
						but the puncture marks linger, leaving veinous scars. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next few days involve a series of sleepwalking episodes with <span class="npc">Meindel</span>, 
						<span class="npc">Jarrod</span>, <span class="npc">Stool</span>, and <span class="npc">Nar</span>. During 
						their sleeping or watches these partymembers attempted to leave the Tiny Hut, and when questioned have 
						no memory of attempting to do so. Things culminate when Onnie attempts to <i>lay on hands</i>, which 
						provokes Jarrod into attacking. Although he jukes <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>, <span class="pc">Francis</span>
						tackles him to the ground and <span class="pc">Shithead</span>casts <i>lesser restoration</i> which seems  
						to help him recover his senses. He swears that Onnie had caused his flesh to melt where she had touched him.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						On the 18th day since leaving Mithril Hall, Zodius presages a battle with several <span class="npc">Shadow Demons</span>
						in his orb, and the party decides to take a safer route. On the 21st day Zodius again has visions, this time of a 
						odd <span class="npc">Basilisk</span> wearing a red vest, which he interprets as a 'good omen'. By the 22nd day 
						some of the party are concerned that the ring is misleading them, that maybe they are lost in the dark depths of 
						the Underdark.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						On the 22nd day the party hears old folk songs from many races echoeing down the passage ahead. Following them they 
						come to the Basilisk from Zodius' visions, who introduces itself as <span class="npc">Veldyskar</span>, and 
						bids the party follow for a few hours to the twin basalt doors of mighty <span class="location">Gravenhollow</span>!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						On the way Veldyskar speaks little, offering curt repsonses about the library. From it the party learns that 
						the library is magical, is 'it's own master', and that there are three librarians. They also learn that 
						Veldyskar is a servant of the library. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Will the library shed light on the mystery of the Demon Lords in the Underdark? Is is it secret? ... is it safe?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session62">
					<h3>Session 62: Super Fly(s)</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The flies descend onto the party and their mind-altering drone 
						stuns some of the party not favored by <span class="pc">Onnie's</span>
						<i>Aura of protection</i>. Many of the fly demons attack but 
						all are slain despite a few scary bites on <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>
						and <span class="pc">Zodius</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Francis</span> decides to kill the last 
						fly by leaping onto it over a nearby dark pool, unfortunately he tumbles 
						into the pool and the fly is slain by ranged fire. While swimming out and 
						climbing the wall at the pools edge, a 15' psuedopod emerges from the pool's 
						center...
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						What ghastly foe lurks within the pool? Can the adventurers survive it's wrath?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session61">
					<h3>Session 61: Everin Restored</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Resting up with food and drink at the Zhentarim enclave, with the drow slaughter 
						accomplished, the gallants discuss their next move. <span class="pc">Everin</span> is resurrected
						using the duergar scroll, and looks like hell.  It is decided that investigating 
						the plight of <span class="npc">Yantha Coaxrock</span> is worthwile, so the 
						crew heads over to the duergar enclave. After a brief meeting with a drab 
						guardsman the party meet with the venerable drow clerk <span class="npc">Ghuldar</span>, 
						who agrees to allow 3 of the less violent appearing party members meet with Yantha. <span class="pc">Onnie, Zodius, and Everin</span>
						are selected.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Just before the enclave doors, Ghuldar opens a small stone hole in the wall 
						through which Yantha may be heard and spoken with. Zodius asks her how she is 
						and she gives a confused answer calling him 'stone child' and remarking that 
						she will be ok as she plans to befriend the <span class="npc">Xorn</span> over 
						which she is suspended by sympathizing with the beast's intestinal lining. Zodius 
						and the gang conclude she is daft, and that the duergar leader is also crazed but that 
						these issues are not worth troubling over in the face of the imperative of getting to 
						<span class="location">Gravenhollow</span>. To that end the party return to 
						the Zhentarim and leave Yantha and the duergar to whatever doom awaits them.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the Zhentarim camp <span class="npc">Ghazrim</span> offers the party a ring 
						which points unerringly toward Gravenhollow. As Onnie is the only one impressed by 
						this ring Ghazrim asks that she specifically wear it. He also provides the party 
						with their share of the drow loot: <i>cap of water breathing</i>, a <i>potion of waterbreathing</i>,
						4 <i>potions of healing</i>, 2 <i>immovable rods</i>, and a <i>+1 bolt</i>. The party begins their 
						journey into the blackness once again...
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first day's travel goes well, and in the evening <span class="npc">Nar</span> and Everin
						meet a strange Elven druid named <span class="npc">Sladis Vadir</span> who wishes to return
						with the group to the surface. He claims to have been living in the Underdark the past 2 ish 
						years and has become lost. Everin is most distrustful and <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						holds a claw to Sladis' throat, deciding against killing him only after <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						encourages him to kill. Sladis offers everyone a bite of his Quaggoth arm, which he is eating raw. 
						When Seven-Stars asks for a drow limb instead Sladis pulls one out of his pack.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next day Zodius studies the ring and decides that the journey to Gravenhollow will take 
						at least 65 days, but teleporting to <span class="location">Mithril Hall</span> will cut off 
						some time. The gang prepares to teleport and as Zodius casts the spell and steps through the 
						one-turn portal Sladis attempts to tackle Seven-Stars to the ground. Everin the ever-watchful
						stabs him, and another shank from Seven-Stars kills him. Seven-Stars takes the body through the 
						portal.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						To the relief of everyone the teleport is successful, the walls of <span class="location">Moradinach Drach</span>,
						the temple of Moradin, appearing out of the darkness. High preist <span class="npc">Khazzrack Grindol</span> greets 
						the party and is disheartened to see that none of the dwarf warriors who left on the adventure have survived. He is 
						further disheartned to see Everin dump several pounds of corpse limbs onto the temple floor out of the magical 
						bag Vladis was carrying. Shithead's expert negotiating skills come into play also, and the thoroughly insulted 
						priest kicks the party out of the temple.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Led to the lower gates of Mithril Hall, the gang passes through the barred tunnel and into the blackness again. Zodius 
						conludes there are only 20-22 days away from the Library. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next few days are relatively uneventful: <span class="npc">Nar</span> comes down with a bad cough but Onnie 
						immediatly cures him and the remains of a small group of murdered drow are discovered, their bodys badly torn. On 
						the eigth day, while traveling across a wider chamber the party hears an earsplitting droning buzz, realizing with 
						dread that this same sound came from the loathsome demon-flies that attacked <span class="location">Velkynvelve</span>
						months ago. This time the flies are after the gallants! Who will survive?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session60">
					<h3>Session 60: Drow Massacre III</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Drow lay dead and dying, and the gang continues killing. The last surviving drow 
						flees down a dark passage, closely pursued by <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>.
						To her dread the tunnel is a dead end, turning she fires at her pursuers before perishing 
						under their attacks. <span class="pc">Onnie</span> goes angel mode and attacks the 
						ire of the <span class="npc">Abyssal Spider</span>, and suffering a grievous blow 
						from it's puncturing legs.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The spider is slain by the combined might of the gallants, and the drow corpses
						proficiently scalped. Returning the <span class="npc">Ghazrim</span> the party
						meets with the duergar leader, <span class="npc">Krimgol</span>, who trades 
						the <i>black gem</i> for a <i>scroll of raise dead</i>. <span class="npc">Onnie</span>
						studies the scroll and prepares to ressurect <span class="pc">Everin</span> while
						the rest of the gang consider rescuing <span class="npc">Yantha Coaxrock</span>, leader
						of the deep gnome enclave, from the duergar, or just getting back to Ghazrim and 
						getting the information on <span class="location">Gravenhollow</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Will Everin return? How far is Gravenhollow? Huh?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session59">
					<h3>Session 59: Drow Massacre II</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang find a 100' wide chamber, into which lead 9 passages from the catacombs. Guarding these 
						passages the party waits for the drow, who begin arriving a few rounds later. Drow warriors and merchants
						fall to the relenless blows of the party, but spiders and more spiders start slowing down the 
						party's murder capacity. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A <span class="npc">abyssal spider</span> appears in the widest passage but is blocked by the 
						<span class="pc">Shield Guardian</span>. Four <span class="npc">Giant Spiders</span>, 7 <span class="npc">Drow Merchants</span>,
						2 <span class="npc">Drow Warriors</span>, and the abyssal spider remain, with 4 drow about to flee down 
						the corridors.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A giant spider is poised to bite <span class="pc">Zodious</span>, and several drow are 
						about to escape, can the party stop the fleeing drow, or even survive the spiders?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session58">
					<h3>Session 58: Drow Massacre I</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The gallants decide to kill drow and head to the spider infested catacombs above the drow enclave.
						Their to the catacombs, a Zhentarim thug name <span class="npc">Glendor</span> gets them close to the 
						entrance only to be webbed by a bloated pink arachnid. Killing the spiders is easy enough, and Glendor 
						survives, pausing to point a trembling finger toward several narrow passages before returning to the 
						Zhents. The party advances into the tunnels, planning to leave no drow alive, an important motive
						as drow survivors could implicate the Zhentarim in the attack.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The catacombs prove fairly easy to navigate since the goal is simply to descend, and the group finds a 
						small opening that looks down onto the drow enclave's main floor. Two small stone warehouses are being emptied,
						their goods stacked outside while <span class="npc">nine quaggoths</span>, <span class="npc">eighteen drow merchants</span>, 
						and <span class="npc">four warriors</span>, oh and <span class="npc">six giant riding lizards</span>. The gallants decide 
						to watch for a bit.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Tensions seem high between the drow warriors and the merchants, especially when the drow realize they are blocked 
						in from their 'secret' exit. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> decides to shake the drow up some more and casts his voice into the ceiling with an 
						ominous cackle. One of the males tries to fly up to the ceiling to escape and the warriors attack him but 
						he manages to survive... until <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> puts an arrow through his skull, drawing the attention
						of the warriors.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The warriors float up to the opening which is only large enough to allow 2 of the party to attack from. <span class="npc">Shield Guardian</span>
						blocks the opening and clutches at the warriors who cast <i>darkness</i> into opening. The remaining drow merchants 
						are attempting to float up to some of the other openings in the ceiling and the party decides to retreat back up the tunnels 
						where they hope to cut off any hope of escape. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Will the party be able to kill 'em all? Will anyone feel guilty? Do the drow have a secret weapon?

					<h3>Session 57: Meeting Ghazrim</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang leashes <span class="npc">Zilchyn</span> the drow mage and have him lead them to 
						the Zhentarim enclave where they discover a well-furnished tent with a fine collection of 
						throw pillows. A thug comes out of a pair of double stone doors north of the tent, then retreats
						back into the doors after seeing most of the party enjoying the cushions. He returns with 11 
						fellow thugs and a <span class="npc">Beholder</span> whose presence enforces a polite demeanor
						rare among the gallants.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The beholder almost notices the pillow clawed by <span class="pc">Seven Stars</span> but 
						the cat is too quick to be caught. The beholder instructs the gallants to wait in a side 
						tent while summoning <span class="npc">Ghazrim</span>. A thug plays dice with <span class="pc">Onnie</span>
						and wins 50 gp.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Ghazrim arrives and a deal is made for the party to attack the drow that are coming to a meeting with 
						the Zhents in an hour. But when the meeting starts a drow attacks quickly forcing the party to attack 
						without a signal from Ghazrim. Ghazrim nearly dies but is healed by Onnie who also summons a magic weapon 
						and also summons a magic flame sword with a mysterious 'magic action' mechanic. The drow leader is slain 
						but a fellow drow, who then attacks <span class="pc">Shithead</span>, and is slain while clutching a 
						large black gem to her chest.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> examines the gem, but can discern little other then it's eerie vibes. He 
						carefully places the gem in his pack. Ghazrim suggests the party kill the remaining drow and split the 
						loot with the Zhents. Zilchyn escapes narrowly through a ceiling crack by flying. Ghazrim also mentions 
						getting the duergar cleric to ressurect <span class="pc">Everin</span>, the gem the party found is 
						supposedly the duergar's and he may be willing to perform the service in exchange for the gem.

					<h3>Session 56: Everin Falls at Mantol Derith</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang climbs the face of the ravine to see duergar slaughtering deep gnomes. They rush to the aid of the 
						gnomes, eventually killing 25 duergar attacking the gates of the deep gnome trade enclave. They learn from one 
						of the deep gnome survivors that the duergar attacked after the sale of a gem went awry between a duergar and 
						the leader of the deep gnome enclave, <span class="npc">Xantha Coaxrock</span>. Xantha is known by name to the 
						party as the leader of the <span class="npc">Stoneheart Enclave</span>, the group that created <span class="npc">Rocky</span>
						The party also meet a gnome named <span class="npc">Peebles</span> who is visiting mantol-derith, and has a erratic left eye. 
						Peebles is knocked out while attempting to flee, and <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> loots the thread from his purse. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Everin</span> heads over to spy on some drow female warriors across the ravine and learns that they are waiting 
						for the duergar/deep gnome conflict to play out before attacking the victor and splitting both duergar and deep gnome
						enclave's goods with the Zhentarim enclave. Everin listens until the drow split up, leaving a single sentinal behind. 
						A handsome young Zhentarim thug then approaches and flirts with the drow, who rebuffs his advances, threatening to gut him. The 
						thug says he will see her later when the Zhentarim meet with the drow at the Zhentarim pavilion.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Everin waits a moment for the drow to be alone, then holds a knife to her throat, promising death if she doesn't explain the drow 
						intentions. She grimly repeats the drow intent to attack the duergar, but now that the adventureres have done killed many duergar the 
						drow may offer the mercanies money to kill the rest of the duergar. While saying this last bit she twists and slips away but Everin 
						manages a grievous throat slash as she does. She attempts to fly away but an arrow from <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> from across the
						map lays her low. Everin retrieves a clean scalp, then heads closer to the drow enclave to learn more.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the drow enclave entrance is a large zurkwood mushroom, 20' high. Seated amongst the poisonous fungi below is a drow male wizard. Six 
						stone gargoyles and 4 drow female warriors flank an impressive closed stone door. Not seeing much action here Everin decides to head back, 
						but is ambushed by the gargoyles and drow, because of his distance from the group it is a full round before the party arrives, seeing 
						Everin ravaged by the gargoyles. He recovers enough to crawl away as the party move around to defend but the gargoyles are relentless 
						and Everin perishes under 6 pairs of rending claws.

					<p class="Core">
						<span class="figure"><img src="media/images/gargoyles.png" width="200px" height="200px" alt="tyler">"Did we do that?"</span>
						The party destroys the gargoyles and kills two drow warriors before the other two vanish into a cloud of magical darkness in 
						obscuring the stone door. Seven-Stars accosts the fleeing drow wizard who was under the mushroom and convinces him to land. The 
						combat continues but the party realizes Everin has died and <span class="pc">Shithead</span> cannot <i>revivify</i> him. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						What will happen now? Will Zodius risk an Abyssal Convergance and teleport with Everin's body to a temple? Will <span class="npc">Stool</span>
						raise Everin as a myconid? Maybe there is someone in town that can help? What is going on in the cloud of blackness in front of the 
						drow doors?

					<h3>Session 55: Phase Goblins & Arrival at Mantol Derith</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang continues on their way, led by <span class="npc">Kazook</span>. Traveling
						across a large cavern <span class="pc">Zodius</span> has a vision of a 
						mass of goblin-spider-riders ambushing the party from the ethereal plane. He has
						just enough time to warn the rest of the group before the goblins apparate and 
						battle is joined! 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first few seconds seem dire, with Zodius badly poisoned by a spider, despite this 
						the group senses the possibility of more goblins in hiding and demand of fate that 
						the goblins appear. They do so and the group manages to wipe out the greenies 
						with a well placed fireball and a <span class="pc">Onnie's</span> frightening 
						presence. After the battle the gang finds an unusual spell scroll meant for hiding 
						items known as 'Immurks Distraction'.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With the goblins slain the group presses towards <span class="location">Mantol Derith</span>,
						resting before arriving. A <span class="npc">Carrion Crawler</span> with a saddle is slain 
						and <span class="npc">Margo</span> dies in a rockfall. Her death was likely caused by 
						<span class="pc">Shithead</span>, who, while the party attempted to dig Margo free of the 
						rubble, cast Bane, under the guise of casting bless. When the party reached Margo they 
						found her dead, choked on dust.   
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Kazook <a href="handouts/mantol-derith.html">describes Mantol Derith</a> in some detail along the way. The entrance to the trading hub is hidden behind a pair of 
						secret doors, which Kazook activates. The group then enter a narrow passage with high
						walls. A shattered mass of crystal is piled to one side in the passage, which Kazook 
						describes as a magical lift that broke some years ago. He rings a bell on the wall and 
						explains that another of 4 lifts will be lowered soon to lift the party out of the passage
						and up into the part of the cavern where the 4 trading enclaves are.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A few minutes pass and Kazook wonders at the delay, as duergar
						manage the lifts and are ever-punctual. He becomes agitated after 
						another minute, then a deep-gnome body comes hurtling down the chasm
						smashing into the pile of crystals! Something must be very wrong!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Fortunately the wall has handholds and the party starts climbing, the 
						sounds of battle can be heard the party climbs toward the opening 
						above them... what could be happening?

					<h3>Session 54: Blingdenstone Revisted</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang climbs out of the pit, using the spelunking gear 
						from the fallen deep gnomes. The Shield Guardian doesn't know how to climb so the party hauls it's 
						inept frame up the cliff. <span class="pc">Francis</span> shines as the the best climber among the crew.
						While tugging the Shield Guardian up the gang spots a stray innocent carrion crawler and blast it, slaying 
						it instantly. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> mercilessly shocks it's corpse with lightning just to be sure.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The gallants move along with the last surviving gnome somberly navigating. The surviving help that was 
						sent along from Mithril Hall takes up some of the social space in the party (exception Shield Guardian). 
						<span class="npc">Stool</span> hangs close to Onnie, swaddled in pajamas. <span class="npc">Nar</span> telepathically
						bombards the party with war stories between puffs of tobacco and halfling herb spliffs. <span class="npc">Elem</span> hums
						dwarven songs and confides to everyone that he is "good at keeping secrets". <span class="npc">Jarrod Jotull</span> spoils 
						for another fight. <span class="npc">Margo</span> has red hair. And <span class="npc">Meindel</span> is very excitable and 
						enthusiastic despite the recent slaughter.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Two days pass, one of which takes the party through fungi-laden cavern where Stool remains quiet about the 
						rare size altering fungi it spots. With the party at beleagured but yet undefeated <span class="location">Blingdenstone</span>
						they meet with <span class="npc">Senni</span> and <span class="npc">Dorbo</span>, the Queen and King of the settlement. 
						The town still has ooze problems but the oozes battle each other. All mining outside the town has stopped as madness grips those
						who travel alone or are far from the town. The old priest of the town has had a vision revealing that <span class="npc">Jubilex</span> 
						is also loose in the underdark!. The royals 
						suggest the party coerce the local alchemist-merchant <span class="npc">Kazook Pickshine</span> into leading them to 
						<span class="location">Mantol Derith</span>. The party heads to the trade spot and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> grows 3 feet taller 
						while intimidating the previously hesitent Kazook to lead the way to Mantol Derith.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Unwilling to delay the party leaves Blingdenstone with Kazook, who brings along 15 alchemist fires, a potion of water breathing, a potion 
						of fire breathing, and 5 greater healing potions (4d4+8). On the second day the gang encounters a cavern filled with <span class="npc">Fire Beetles</span>,
						but sneak past with a diversion. The following day a patch of posionous mold drops on <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> who nimbly avoids it, though 
						his nearby companions Jarrod and <span class="npc">Everin</span> suffer briefly before Onnie stops the poison from destroying their lungs.

						The next day a fierce tattooed gablin intercepts the party demanding they "drop their gear and their britches". Fed up with underdark nonsense
						<span class="pc">Galifraen</span> looses two arrows into it's gut before it vanishes into the air. Evernin notes the tattoos match those of

					<h3>Session 53: Mithril Hall II & The Mook Massacre</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						After the feast the party splits up to make buddies with the various factions. They have some success 
						and <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> considers ambushing an old dwarven servant with a haunting demeanor. 
						Visiting the servant's son's home, they find an odd <span class="npc">bat breeder</span> named Gili. Seven-Stars
						purchase bats for everyone, most notably a bat with latching gold claws, a vampire bat, and a dumb bat that 
						flies into the furnace nearby when released from it's cage. (Galifraen's bat)
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The gang makes some final arrangments with Mithril Hall locals before descending into the Underdark. They 
						gain the assistance of a <span class="npc">Shield Guardian</span> in exchange for <span class="npc">Rocky</span>.
						Five dwarven guards, three human guards, 2 knights of the gauntlet, and three human spies also accompany the party 
						on their way to <span class="location">Blingdenstone</span> where the party hopes to find passage to <span class="location">Mantol Derith</span>,
						an underdark trading hub between the Zhentarim, Blingdenstone, Menzoberranzan, and Gracklstugh.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The descent out of Mithril Hall is somber, leaving the warmth and light of the dwarven hold, and more importantly, the 
						easy access to the surface. Three days pass in the deepening back, and on the fourth the gnomish guides lead the party 
						across a newly formed ravine. While crossing the ravine, at it's bottom, a swarm of <span class="npc">carrion crawlers</span>
						emerge from the holes in the walls and ambush the party.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A tense 30 second battle ensues, with many of the new party members parlyzed and eaten by the crawlers. Finally the creatures are

						continue toward Blingdenstone, which should be 2 days away.

						The party enters the hall from the Surbin Gate and is recognized by a gate guard named

						and leads them across the city, through 5 checkpoints, to the King's throne room. A brief

						to Mithril Hall today and in the evening a feast will be held for everyone to meet.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Kilmur leads the party to their chambers, a long ways off. The chambers are nice and

						the furnace nearby where it works and they agrees.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the furnace Onnie's spear attracts the interest of a sly magma mephit with a stone 
						crown. The dwarves at the forge are alarmed at the mephit and <span class="pc">Francis</span>
						shanks it in the neck. A combat ensues with 9 magmin and 3 fire mymidons attacking the party

						At the Vault the gang reads <a href="handouts/demon-research1.html">some information on demons</a> provided by <span class="npc">Sage Crabtree</span>, but before asking questions 
						Galifraen's relationship with <span class="npc">Tyler</span> rears it's ugly head. Tyler attempts to sprout from Galifraen's shoulder
						and take over his body, and begins chanting causing one of the research books to animate. The book flutters to life and attempts to 
						transport the party to another plane, but is unsuccessfull while Onnie, Zodius, and Galifraen hack at Tyler-lump. <span class="figure">
							<img src="media/images/tyler.png" width="200px" height="200px" alt="tyler">"Tyler"
						</span>
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The plane shifting attempts of the book cause disruptions in the city's wards which rouses gaurds and townsfolk and alerts 
						Evernin, Francis, and Seven-Stars to trouble at the Vault of Sages. Before they can leave there they see 88 and 99 with tears of 
						joy over the disruption. Seven-Moons approaches and looks at something in their hands, proving his worth as a friend of theirs. Taking 
						Seven-Moons into their confidence they head to the vault to try and aid whatever is happening, with Francis and Everin tailing. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						They find the vault secured by the Knights in Silver and the Spellguard, but slip in a side window disguised as clerks carrying 
						pickled Okra for an ornery sage upstairs. Everin and Francis likewise dress as clerks and use the same ruse to gain access. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						On the third floor Onnie, Everin, and Zodius manage to subdue Tyler, and cut his tennis-ball sized spherical body out of 
						Galifraen's shoulder. The book seems destroyed after being pierced by Onnie's lance. Failing to drag the adventurers to 
						another plane, it explodes in a shower of fleshy parchment and gore. Knights and Spellguard enter the ruined study chamber and
						decide to escort the party to <span class="pc">Lady Alustriel</span> for questioning. One of the Spellguard stabs Tyler through the 
						body and puts him in an Okra jar taken from Seven-Stars (who is disguised as a clerk). The guards then lead the Zodius, Onnie, and 
						Galifraen out towards wherever Lady Alustriel is.

					<p class="Core">
						Seven-Stars, 88, and 99 wait in an adjoining chamber and decide to try and steal a book from the study where the chaos happened. 
						88 and 99 distract the guards with puking and Seven-Stars slips in and steals the book, then slips out. Francis follows Seven-Stars
						out of the chamber and the Vault of Sages, where he learns that Seven-Stars recovered the book. Francis is uneasy about Seven-Stars
						apparent loyalty to 88 and 99, suspecting whatever happened when Seven-Stars looked at the thing in 88's hand to be related.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Everin stays in the hall and demands 88 and 99 'get those Okra upstairs', Unfortunately he botches the fib and the guard becomes 
						suspicious. When 88 also fails at lying 99 bolts down the hall. Everin throws off his clerk disguise and points at 99, 'get the imposter'.
						After a moment of indecision the guard tackles 99 who is then professionally rope-tied by Evernin. 88 is also captured and 
						is also tied by Everin who the guards decide to escort to Lady Alustriel after hearing Everin's story about coming to check on his 
						friends who were in the chamber when the chaos happened.

					<h3>Session 47: Silverymoon I</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party is nearly at <a href="handouts/silverymoon.html">Silverymoon</a>! One day remains. Searching the corpses of the dead adventurers around 
						Aldor the Kind finds 8 healing potions, a clay medallion of a bear on a necklace with magical properties, 
						a longsword, a shortsword, a shield, and 400 gp. Gathering and dividing this the party heads on their 
						last days journey to the city.	
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Shortly after daybreak they are intercepted by riders (<span class="npc">The Knights in Silver</span>) from a old keep overlooking 
						the River Rauvin. The riders inspect Nesmit's silks briefly and entertain some questions from the party 
						to the mounting impatience of Nesmit. Two of the riders are members of the <span class="npc">Spellguard</span>
						who tell <span class="pc">Onnie</span> about magic school opportunities in Silverymoon. As well as good places
						to stay. <span class="npc">Lethywin Silvergrace</span>, the chef the party rescued in the Underdark adds that 
						he worked at one of the finest taverns in Silverymoon, <span class="location">The Golden Oak Inn</span>. <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						notices that the knight in silver wear a crest (Three towers and with a crescent across the base) that was found 
						on a bangle on a corpse in the underdark. She thinks hard and recalls the inscription on the bangle said "Serve well my son, my dear <span class="npc">Polonius Rufleton</span>"
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party arrives within sight of the city and notes the magical pink ward encompassing the entire town. <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						recalls from his days at school that these wards protect cities from weather extremes and also  have other protective magics woven in.
						The city is full of pleasant folk, architecture, and sounds. Traveling over the Moonbridge to Nesmit's warehouse, and then to a counting 
						house the party is paid their 6,000 gp and part with Nesmit. <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> is eyed oddly by a child who wonders 
						aloud if he is one of 'High Mage Cateye's Children'. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						They head to the Golden Oak Inn and meet <span class="npc">Cromwell</span>, the half-elven host who gives them a deal of 3 gp/night for the 
						first 8 days on the finest level 'The Canopy'. The Inn has a dryad playing a lute at the base of a massive oak that is the central feature of
						the inn, all rooms and dining areas are connected or in view of the oak. After a brief check in the group relaxs upstairs with the exception 
						of Shithead who opts for the stables. Two young nobles from Waterdeep, Stelar and Khollos Nasher, are chatting in the hall and Shithead
						encourages Stelar to use her familes money to attend school if she cannot get in on merit. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back downstairs with Cromwell the party enjoys hourdeavours and apertifs and ask Cromwell about adventurer work in the city. He 
						lists many opportunities, including hunting in the Moonwood, relic retrieval for sages, joining the spellguard... the party decides
						that today they want to vist the <span class="location">Fortune Hall</span>, the <span class="location">Vault of Sages</span>, and 
						go shopping.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the Vault of Sages the party enquires about demon-related books and is promised a quote by the afternoon. Seven-Stars tails a 
						suspicious half-elf who disliked Onnie out and back to the half-elf's digs at <span class="location">The Cursed Arrow</span>. There
						he gets a job investigating Onnie from the half-elf who calls himself '88' and who does not know Seven-Stars (now Seven-Moons) is 
						Onnie's associate. 88 makes some strange comments in Abbysal to a stilleto wielding halfing as well.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At Fortune Hall Onnie finds Shithead worshipping, a surprise to her. They both meet with the head priestess <span class="npc">Anura Shar</span>.
						Offering her services as an adventurer Onnie is encourage to speak with one of the local nobles, <span class="npc">Baldura Weatherford</span> and
						her husband, Rufus, about the idol of Waukeen that purportedly exists on a dead adventurer from long ago in the Moonwood, a location that the 
						previous high priestess died trying to get to just 10 days ago. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party goes shopping. There are many shops visted with the end result being Zodius gets a hat of wizards and some spell components, Onnie 
						gets a warped magical lance, Seven-Stars gets a cloak, 12 +1 bolts, and a adventurers pack. Shithead grabs a +1 shortsword that glows 
						white, supposedly only when the wielder is safe.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Seven-Stars then enacts an elaborate plan of subterfuge where he gets spotted at every inn he can find, where he makes enemies with a 
						dwarf and mage from <span class="location">The Half-Drunk Tankard</span>, but avoids them later in the night. Then he arrives at 
						The Cursed Arrow and chats with the halfing associate of 88, who calls herself 99. When she retires he finds a quote from 
						the Vault of Sages crumpled next to her parsnip soup.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After an exhausting day Seven-Stars meets with 88 and 99 and tells them where the party is staying at the Golden Oak, lying 
						to them about the room (the room he mentions is the understory #1, which the party rented as a trap). He also tells them 
						about the party looking into two-headed demons. After collecting his fee Seven-Stars leaves. The party also gets their quote from
						the Vault of Sages. 30 gp/day to access the reading room and the relevant books. Infernal and Abyssal are required languages, to hire 
						a sage to perform the research the cost goes up to 50 gp/day.

						The adventurers allow <span class="npc">Tillian</span> to purge the shrine of Vaprak, and watch as a 10' mailed
						fist plummets from the sky into the shrine, destroying it. Or seeming to... left behind is a lemon
						sized sphere emiting a faint green light. It smells of vinegar and is pocketed by <span class="pc">Seven Stars</span>.
						Tillian warns the group that the  sphere is an evil thing, and <span class="pc">Zodius</span> recalls from

						forge powerful, but treacherous, items.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Returing to town the party is hailed as heroes: "Galifraen and his Companions have returned". The leader of Nesme,
						<span class="npc">Tessarin</span>, takes the party back to her tower and treats them to a feast, along with 
						the 2,000 GP reward she promised them. During the conversation the party decides to next take the caravan of the merchant
						<span class="npc">Nesmit</span> to <span class="location">Silverymoon</span> the long way, maybe later they will 
						assist Tessarin with the giants who live in the moors. Tessarin offers to allow the party to use the secret portal 
						connecting Silverymoon and Nesme at a reduced price, when <span class="pc">Zodius</span> and Seven-Stars notice something 
						amiss with Tessarin as the party prepares to leave, and <span class="pc">Oni</span> spots a fiendish presence possessing 
						the candles near Tessarin on the table. The canldes burst out, leaving a black ooze, and Tessarin is uncertain what happened. 
						The party decides to vists <span class="npc">Noristor</span>, the owner of the magicians club in town and ask about the 
						candles and the dark presence. <span class="npc">Xander</span> demands 300 GP from the party for his assistance as a companion, 
						and storms out with the 50 GP granted him from Galifraen.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						There they learn that the candles were non-magical, and that their group has caused the demons enough trouble 
						to get their personal attention. It is likey that if they use the teleporter something will go badly that will 
						aid the demons against the party. Oni recalls that the candles in the <span class="location">Cult of the Red Listen</span>
						had similar candles. The group retires to the inn and sleeps.

					<p class="Core">
						The next morning the party meets with Nesmit, and they head out towards Silverymoon. 3 Wagons, 2 loaded with silk, the 
						3rd with the party's gear (a gift from the dwarves of Mithral hall to Oni), 2 drivers, Nesmit, Xandar, Yurl and Logesh, and Tribur 
						accompany the party. The first two days of travel are uneventful. The party learns that Nesmit is a philsopher-merchant, who 
						trades in fine silks with connections with the finest tailors of the north. Galifraen learns that Silverymoon has two dueling 
						tailors of great reknown who will want to make Galifraen their next fashion project. The party buys silks from Nesmit to make colored 
						scarfs for themselves when they arrive in town, Oni chooses pink.

					<p class="Core">
						On the third day a trio of giants attempt to ambush the party. They send a goblin out to parlay but Galifraen snipes

						is swept up to the central stage to face off with <span class="npc">Logesh</span> the Uthgardt barbarian 
						to see who is the most popular adventurer in Nesme. <span class="npc">Maeleera Eveningtree</span> hosts 
						and <a href="handouts/popularityTrials.html">lists the trials</a> by name, of which three will be chosen for the contestants to compete in. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Galifraen chooses the <strong>Trial of Marksmanship</strong> as the first content and easily bests Logesh when 
						he splits an arrow to hit a target. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> learns from the fire mage <span class="npc">Ro</span>
						that <span class="npc">Noristor the Undying</span> should know more about cults than she does. <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						begins harrasing a red-cloaked muttering guy, <span class="npc">Everin</span> spots two marks, and steals a coinpurse containing 
						70 gp in gems from a paranoid merchant. <span class="pc">Onnie</span> approaches a table of drunk men and attempts to convince them 
						of Galifraen's greatness.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The second trial, <strong>The Trial of Brawn</strong>, begins with several heavy objects being brought out. Galifraen convinces 
						Logesh to instead choose the <strong>Trial of Blows</strong> so instead of lifting heavy objects the contestants will punch each 
						other in the face until one of them lets go the others chest. Unfortunately Galifraen lets go after the second blow from 
						Logesh. Onnie almost convinves the table of bros to cheer for Galifraen but the alpha of the table sneers at her talk about an 
						after-party as "gay" and the others take his side. Everin fails to steal a piece of jade from an Uthgardt's axe, Seven-Stars
						and the culty guy get in a screaming match about harrasing that no one pays heed to, Zodius meets with the one-armed bard, <span class="npc">Tonkin</span>
						, and learns that there is a successfull bard named <span class="npc">Reginald</span> who will sing for Logesh if needed.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The third trial, <strong>The Trial of Tumbling</strong> comes next, where contestants must leap in some marvelous way from the balcony 
						onto the stage. As the contestants ascend the stairs to the balcony the rest of the party gets into trouble. Seven-Stars leaves the 
						cultist and turns himself into a strangely attractive woman (<span class="npc">Stareena</span>) who talks with the priestess of Waukeen, <span class="npc">Jygil</span>, about
						economics up the stairs in the VIP section, Onnie flashes the bros to get them 
						to cheer for Gali, Everin manages to steal the jade off the Uthgardt axe, and Zodius continues to grumble. Galifraen leaps first from 
						the balcony but misses his mark, managing a mediocre landing, wheras Logesh belly flops straight through a banner in a more imppressive landing.
						Fortunately the crowd is not impressed with this as a final trial and cry for a fourth trial. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The fourth trial begins, <strong>Trial of Barding</strong>, where bards will compete to tell them most fantastic tale of 
						their patrons exploits. One of the dwarves from Mithral Hall volunteers for Galifraen and ascends the stage with his 
						bagpipe, Galifraen tries to suggest some highlights to cover but provides too much detail, and the dwarf smiles and nods 
						blankly. As the tale begins Onnie gets the bros to cheer again for Gali's bard, but fails to convice the veterans, though 
						they like the story nonetheless, Everin spots another two marks, choosing the unconcious youth in fine gear and bulging coinpurse
						over a self-important merchant, Stareena gets the VIPs to dance during the dwarf's tale, and Zodius gets kicked off the bartop.
						Reginald spins a tale of Logesh's valor but it's not as interesting as the new guy so it seems like Galifraen is going to win. Onnie and 
						Everin manage to win a game of Menchirun Black Dice to secure the cheers of the veterans.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Logesh demands a fifth trial but is shouted down by the crowd and Galifraen is designated "Adevnturer Maxime of Nesme", the 
						most popular. Seven-Stars takes the leader of <span class="npc">Tessarin Longtresses</span> down to meet Galifraen, Everin steals
						the drunks coinpurse, Zodius leads the outcry against a fifth trial. In the afterglow of victory Galifraen agrees to help 
						destroy the <span class="location">Troll Shrine of Vaprak</span> in exhange for 2000 gp and a "swift secret passage to Silverymoon". Gali enlists the aid of Logesh and some Uthgardt
						and secures two days delay from the merchant. Onnie 
						unwittingly gains the aid of <span class="npc">Tribur</span> the would-be adventurer, and <span class="npc">Frunlingular</span>,
						the adventurebro who thought the afterparty was gay, she is unable to convince the unamed ice mage, "Cold Hands" from joining, 
						and refuses to pay his dwarf friend 600 gp to join up. Everin departs with a fellow rogue to find <span class="npc">Shogarth the Sly</span>,
						a dealer of art, adventurer gear, and the local fence. Zodius travels to Noristor to ask about the location of the shrine.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Everin gets jumped by the rogue but immediately breaks the thugs nose, sending him fleeing. Finding the fence Everin sells the gems 
						but does not like the amount offered by the fence for the jade piece. Another theif in the shop threatens to tell the Uthgardt of the 
						theft in one day's time. Outside Everin is tempted to burgle the only other intact building in the area but notes the door is magically 
						barred and seeks out Zodius.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Zodius learns from Noristor that a troll head holds the secret to the shrine, and is gifted the head and 12 scented wafers that 
						will force the head to answer one question. Leaving Zodius meets with Everin and together they botch an entry to the magically
						secured building by the fence's shop. The black tendrils that reach out snatch up a nearby sleeping guy but Zodius and Everin escape
						unharmed. Seven-Stars loots pockets of folks at the hot tub and gradually the revelers depart to sleep off the excesses of the night.

						find a troll locked in a cell, nearly starved to death. <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						throws the troll some rations but communication is deemed impossible. The group also 
						find a corpse in a pile of straw in one of the smaller cells. It is an uthgard woman.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back in the central hall the group heads down the remaining passage they can explore and 
						find a ruined armory. <span class="pc">Zodius</span> uses detect magic to determine that 
						the two doors in the area are warded in some way, and also spots a ward hanging beyond the 
						prison-style doors in this area. Mage handing through the bars has bad results and sets 
						off the ward at the end of the hall, summoning 4 large bone serpents in the cell!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Fortunately the serperents are trapped on the other side of the bars so the party makes short 
						relatively safe work of them with ranged attacks, suffering only a few lightning bolts. 
						The snakes perish and evaporate leaving a disappointing empty cell and some useless notes 
						in a side desk. The other door in the armory leads to a chamber where Zodius is certain the 
						wards are and a successfull dispel magic negates the ward set in the door that <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						discovers.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Opening this door the party finds a <span class="items">set of adamantine half-plate, 3 arrows of troll slaying, 3 bolts of troll slaying, 
						a magical longsword +1, and 5 suits of splint mail</span>. Seven-Stars finds an additional breastplate and 4 longswords in 
						the refuse of the armory. <span class="pc">Francis</span> boldy opens the chest in this area and finds a bolt 
						of fine silk and a small chest containing 3 inactive wardstones!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With the armory explored and the wardstones found the party decides to head back to town, and maybe to 
						abuse the starving troll a bit more before heading out.

					<h3>Session 38: Nesme 1</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Before retiring for the night on the cold banks of the river Surbin, <span class="pc">Onnie</span> decides
						to toss a stone (small boulder) onto the frozen surface of the river and see what happens. When the ice 
						doesn't crack she decides to venture across in her 60lb splint mail. Unfortunately she plummets through the 
						ice a short way across the river. Seeing this as a heroic opportunity, <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>
						springs into action, attempting to save Onnie, but actually just sliding directly into the hole in ice and
						being swept under by the current.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Things look dire and the rest of the group are roused to help while several guards watch from the 
						wall on the far side of the river. Crisis is averted in grand fasion when <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						melts a portion of the ice with a well-placed fireball, and <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> skates
						over to Onnie and loops some rope about her, then gives Galifraen a hand up. Onnie and Galifraen
						spend the rest of the night drying off by the fire with guards chuckling in shifts on the wall.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						In the morning the "Ferryman" arrives, an old codger named Grendl who attempts to use a magical tablet
						which creates a platform of force for the party to walk across. With the help of Zodius he manages to 
						say the activating word, spoken in Auran, the language of elemental air beings. After crossing the bridge 
						the party is led through the ruined <span class="location">Citadel of the Riders</span>, several frozen spitted heads of orcs, trolls, and hill giants into the south gate of
						<span class="location">Nesme</span>, a battered town of about 2,000 humanoids on the brink
						of collapse.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						All the townsfolk are armed, refugees, or both. Entering through the south gate the party passes a troupe
						of well equipped haughty half-elves who Seven-Stars can't resist secretly tossing a stone at (it misses). A 
						bard missing his left arm approaches the party and asks for some coin, and is invited to show the party around.
						He eagerly accepts and introduces himself as <span class="npc">Torkin</span>, a bard recently arrived who 
						lost his left arm defending the town against trolls. Onnie asks about things to do in town and learns that 
						there are many adventures here, with four or so groups not returning from forays into the monster-infested 
						lands outside of town known as the <span class="location">Evermoors</span>. He also mentions the 7
						inns in town, of which 5 are still standing, the <span class="location">Cat on the Post</span> being 
						the most recently smashed by boulders hurled over the town's walls. He leads the group past a club
						with Unicorn-motif windows called <span class="location">The Wise Unicorn</span>, where a "stuck-up"
						mage named <span class="npc">Nistlor the Undying</span>. The group decides to head to the festhall 
						<span class="location">The Pride of the North</span>, and arrive to find a stage and two longtables 
						though most of the action seems to happen at night. Talking more with their bard friend over drinks the 
						party learns that there are many options open to adventurers, that magic is not permitted in the festhalls or 
						taverns, that orcs, trolls, and most dangerously, hill giants have been fighting each other and attacking the town,
						the Torkin is willing to have a giant's arm grafted to his stump, 
						and that they'll need to make a name for themselves if they want to meet witht he busy town ruler, the sexy wizardess with "nice hair", <span class="npc">Tessarin "Longtresses" Alauran</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party decides to go to the <span class="location">Barracks of the Riders</span> and ask about recovering 
						some valuable magical defensive wards buried in the Citadel of the Riders outside of town. At the barracks they 
						witness guards stabbing a still-living troll tied to a post as a training dummy, and are told that indeed 
						there is a reward for recovering the magical wards but that a fool wizard went into the warded area and exploded 
						so no one has been keen since. Not dissuaded the party decides to head there and investigate, <span class="pc">Francis</span>
						refusing the guards offer of a captive orc as a test subject. Walking around to the ruins Galifraen hurls an 
						empty barrel down the warded stairwell!

					<h3>Session 37: Journey to Nesme</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The companions talk for a bit about what to do next while  enjoying the spa. They decide to head to 
						Mithral hall in exchange for the dwarfs giving them a sleigh. Talking with the dwarven veterans they
						also learn about several nearby settlements. <span class="location">Silverymoon</span>, also called
						"The Gem of the North", is the largest surface settlement close by. It is a cosmopolitan place 
						ruled by a magocracy and protected by powerful magical wards. The architecture impresses even the 
						dwarves with its grace, and numerous greenspaces are rumored to make the city an impressive testament
						to sustainable city planning. The other nearby surface town is <span class="location">Nesme</span>, 
						a much smaller settlement adjacent to a vast moor which has been plagued by attacks from Trolls and 
						Giantkind. The party decides to head to Nesme first, to bash some skulls and do some heroic deeds.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Francis</span> leads the group south to the river Surbin, then follows the river
						west until locating the battered city of Nesme. The journey takes three days and is uneventful 
						despite the dangerous environment, perhaps it being midwinter helps. Although they can see the city
						the river is deemed too risky to cross (it being a sheet of frozen water) so the party set up 
						camp in the ruins of the portion of Nesme that was on the north side of the river. During the night 
						several <span class="npc">Ice Trolls</span> attack, and are killed once they are removed from contact with
						the snowy ground. Archers from the wall on the opposite bank are impressed and tell the adventures that

					<h3>Session 36: Spa Day!!!</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The group learns from <span class="npc">Buttannon</span>, the shivering dwarf with the burned hand, that the Pool Stoker, "Kundular",
						has been misled by unruly spa gremlins and turned it's dwarven kin into kindling. <span class="npc">Kundular</span> 
						is normally resting inside a small stone husk but has rejected that form and become an 8 foot tall dwarven aspected 
						elemental of magma. Unphased the party opts to beat Kundular and the gremlins down, although <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> and 
						<span class="pc">Shithead</span> wonder at the ethics of such and act.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Entering the chamber a pool of water dimly illuminated by deep red light can be seen through a wide passage. <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						and <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> discern high pitched voice from the darkness and Zodius casts a spell enabling him to understand
						the language of the speakers, Ignan. Galifraen then hears Zodius translate the words of the speakers and realizes the gremlins are 
						opening a gate to another plane to take Kundular 'home'. Suddenly the chanting stops, the party has been noticed a fight ensues.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Ten <span class="npc">Magma Gremlin Freedom Fighters</span> attack the party, causing gouts of magma to burst from the walls of the 
						cavern, which eventually wear down <span class="pc">Francis</span>. The battle rages against the gremlins several turns, and as 
						the last three gremlins stand amidst their slain allies, Kundular erupts from a wall near <span class="pc">Shithead</span> and 
						engulfs the dirty little guy, catching the poor fella on fire. <span class="pc">Onnie</span> throws an ice knife and the party 
						learns that cold damage is particulary effective against these gremlins.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Shithead braves more burns and touches Kundular inflicting serious pain before rushing away. Francis is downed by a gremlin and 
						is then further injured when an arrow from Galifraen causes a neaby gremlin to burst onto Francis. Later he miraculously casts two 
						rays of frost in six seconds, downing another two gremlins. <span class="npc">Rocky</span>
						carries Francis to safety and Zodius forces a suggestion into the mind of Kundular. "Go back to the pool and reheat this place. Stop
						these evil creatures from attacking us."
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Kundular moves to obey and the dwarfs from outside rush in to help, but the last gremlin is slain. The party quicky turns on 
						Shithead who manages to evade capture by Galifraen, Onnie, and mental domination by <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>. Zodius
						wanted to capture Shithead too but was stuck debating whether it was worth freeing Kundular from the suggestion it was under.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Everyone except Shithead and the unconcious Francis make their way to the pool to relax and enjoy. The party feels particularly
						inspired by this acheivment. The spend the time wondering what will happen with Kundular... but that a matter for another time. 
						Shithead is pleased to have only bathed in fire so far.

					<h3>Session 35: Spa Day??</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The party (except Shithead) wake to a new day and head towards the spa, for real time. <span class="pc">Francis</span> is 
						certain he is a superior navigator compared to <span class="pc">Seven-Start</span> and proves it by leading 
						the party astray for another 8 hours. As dusk approaches and the bitter cold presses into the bones of the 
						adventures <span class="pc">Zodius</span> and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> let their familiars out to scout
						around. Onnie's familiar, Chance, is struck by arrows from some local ice tribespeople who the party 
						quickly decide to murder as the feel they are on the verge of some great advance. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Using Horace to keep a birds eye on the tribefolk, the party sneaks up on a nearby hill. Francis opts to approach and 
						attempt speaking and starts by 'casually sneaking' up to the tribals in a half crouch. He gets close and allows them to
						push him down into the snow until they try to bind him, at which point he throws off his opressors and starts slashing,
						along with a volley of arrows, bolts, and firebolts from his allies. The tribefolk are overawed by this display of might 
						and immediately attempt to flee, with three of them perishing before escaping over the hill. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Francis intimidates the piss out of one of the wounded survivors and with Zodius's help gets the survivor to agree to 
						lead the party back to Mithril Hall. Horace returns and tells the adventurers that the tribespeople that escaped
						fled to a small warrior camp 2 hours away.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						In the morning the party heads back to the hall and learn the tribefolk are 'Bear Clan' and are at war with the dwarves
						who prohibit them from hunting on Mithril Mountain. The group get back to the base of the mountain and allow the 
						tribal to leave, giving him some rations and a clockwork bird. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						For the past 3 days <span class="pc">Shithead</span> had been drinking Mimosa's from the bottomless yet dwindling 
						casks. They find Shitheat at the bar on the verge of a pass out, unable to vomit. Onnie resolves to find some young 
						hot soldiers to take her and the group to the hot springs instead of relying on the party to get there. An matronly
						dwarf points Onnie to a veteran's hall where she befriends some of the dwarves there and secures a sled ride to the 
						springs the following day.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group then conspires to keep Shithead dead drunk on the way to spa and purchase 2 casks of hard liquor (Firebeard's Belch)
						from the innkeeper. Although Shithead wakes from the stupor a few times Onnie is able to keep him too drunk to realize 
						where he is being taken.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						At the entrance to the springs several of the party pull  some wild entry antics on the treacherous icy
						surface leading down into the cave. Onnie and Sevenstars slam into the walls to avoid hitting the 
						stone door at the foot of the descent while Zodius manages a more gracefull barrel-roll to safety. 
						A shivering dwarf near the door warns the party of the heating spirit that has been roused against 
						the dwarves by fire imps and slew his comrades. This is the dwarf from Zodius's vision!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						What awaits the party in the chamber behind the stone door? It has been spiked to keep the dangers

					<h3>Session 34: Spa Day?</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The group heads downstairs from the inn after a pleasant rest to find a miraculous cache of bottomless
						Mimosas on special, just in from Silverymoon! Then they start looking around for a likely merchant
						to purchase cold weather gear from. They find a guy in well-made clothing and he recommends them 
						to his brother, a tailor who happens to be racist against elves. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>
						senses this and makes off with a husky cloak with the aid of <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With their cold weather gear collected the group looks ready for the cool. <span class="pc">Zodius</span>
						has a mini santa outfit with mismatched reds, <span class="pc">Onnie</span> had a form-fitting outfit 
						with a fur patch missing. <span class="pc">Francis</span> wears a padded leather suit with matching yet 
						uncomfortable boots. They ask about finding an orb and fortunately the tailor has a cousin who sells
						trinkets to magicians.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The trinket seller comes to the door and offers a selection of orbs to Zodius, who picks a clear-blue 
						orb that has been aligned with the resonances of thehh "Xandor Range" and washed with holy waters of 
						Mount Mithril. Galifraen considers asking this diverse family if they have dragon chess sets available
						but spots an enthuthiast outside the home and wins a minature set by soundly defeating the enthuthiast.
						Impressed by this defeat the enthusiast suggests Galifraen enter the championship in Silverymoon next 
						month held at Proudfoot Tavern.

					<p class="Core">
						With their gear for the cold the party heads to the exit, except for <span class="pc">Shithead</span>

						the group follows the expert intuition of Seven-Stars and become lost into nightfall. They build a lean-to
						and prepare to ride out the cold of the night but are attacked by several dire winter wolves! 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Wanting to avoid dogs at all costs, Seven-Stars scampers up the nearest tree before the wolves
						get close. Francis attempts to impress the wolves with his magical glaive and succeeds in causing them 
						to pause and speak amongst themselves. Zodius uses his orb to understand the wolf language and learns 
						that they intend to summon the big one. They start howling.
					</p>
					<p class="core">
						Only Seven-Stars spots the insane creature rushing out of the cold toward the party and is able to launch
						a bolt at it before it crashes into Francis and begans clawing. <span class="npc">Wendingo</span> 
						is fierce and takes a beating, evenutally howling and causing several of the party to become paralyzed
						by the horrible sound.
					</p>
					<p class="core">
						The wolves rush in and attack the paralyzed victims as the Wendigo is bludgeoned to death and erupts 
						into a mass of frozen gore, dousing much of the camp, Onnie, Galifraen, Rocky, and Francis. Spa day! 
						The combat continues several more rounds until at last the wolves are slain or fleeing. Galifraen is
						finnally able to recover from his combat-long paralysis and let off an arrow at the last surviving 
						wolf. 
					</p>
					<p class="core">Zodius then breaks into a sweat and has an intense vision in his new orb, which the rest 
						of the party can see. A passage leading down into the earth emits steam and heat, a dwarf shivvers in the

						about the imps are the burned bodies of several dwarves.

						<span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> pops crossbow shots for most of the battle but also nearly saves one of the friendly elementals
						from destruction with a bold Tai Chi move. 
						Finally, after nearly a dozen misfires, a mythic shot from Galifraen fells one of the last 
						two elementals. Moments later <span class="pc">Francis</span> destroys the last one. During the battle three smaller elementals known
						as "Galeb-Dur" animated near the monolith, and though one was destroyed during the battle the temple seems to have been successfully cleansed

						This noble deed accomplished, the party congradulate themselves by looting her home, finding 3 valuable drow formal dresses, as well

						At the quarry the group meet <span class="npc">Nomi Pathshutter</span>, a deep gnome mage who relates who studies of the evil influence 
						to the group and raps with Zodius about the problem using the latest arcane terminology. From this chat the group learns that the

						In the midst of the groups confusion a troupe of 18 myconids arrived in the garden and began performing

						by several bridesmaids. This vision caused further trouble in the minds of Galifraen and Seven-Stars with
						Galifraen running breifly toward the rehersal group before collapsing in a dialated-eyed heap. Seven-Stars

						One day out from the grove a pair of sentient fungi (myconids) intercepted the group and took over for the

						The first view of the grove was breathtaking, a colorful vista of mushrooms, molds, pools and mist. After

						meets with the group to explain that something is amiss with it's co-sovering, <span class="npc">Phylo</span>, who
						has been behaving erratically. Basidia explains that Phylo has began introducing ideas to the colony that are 
						fracturing their unity and has been promising a wondrous furture with the "seed mother". Basidia asks the group 
						to accept the invitation to <span class="location">The Garden of Welcome</span> from Phylo. Basidia also 
						noticed that <span class="npc">Sarith</span> appear to be host to some alien spores, not seeded from any colony 
						native to the Underdark. Sarith is defensive but recalls that he may have picked up the spores when a supply
						caravan he was in was attacked by myconids and when he came to he was being imprisoned for killing his fellow
						caravan guards. Finally Basidia notes that a band of drow visted the grove a few days ago and should be around
						somewhere.

						Bursting into the cultist chamber the group began slaughtering the innocent derro, starting with 
						<span class="pc">Galifraen</span> sniping one of them in the head. <span class="pc">Onnie</span> then
						attempted to eat 3 ounces of  mushrooms and double her stature but the last ounce
						made her violently ill. A two-headed giant tried to protect its derro friends from the bloodthirsty
						adventureres but was charmed into attacking them instead by a sinister suggesion from <span class="pc">Zodius</span>.
						The last surviving derro tried to become invisible to give itself a chance but Zodius made his eyes magic
						so he could see invisible creatures, foiling the derro's plan.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Everin</span> had been charging up until this point and unleashed his wrath on the 
						giant and slaying a death hound that had been attacking him for some time. Onnie chopped off one of the 
						hound's heads, then split it's leg in two in a frenzied search for 5 (or less) pound hunk of hound. She 
						then launched this dog leg and magically accelerated it into the giant's body, killing the giant.

					<p class="Core">
						The semi-invisible derro flew around the ceiling hoping to somehow stop the barbarity of the invaders but was

						the last derro plummeted head-first toward the statue the cult had been focusing on but was struck by Everin, Zodius,
						and Galifraen and crumpled, dead, upon the floor. The group then ransacked the cultist's home and stealing some gold, silver,
						and crossbows. A book containing two rituals, one for enslaving lesser animals, and another for causing a creature to sprout 
						a second head and go mad was also recovered and translated by Zodius. With these items and nothing left to kill the party
						returned towards the exit of the <span class="location">Whorlstone Tunnels</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Before leaving Everin decided to murder the father-of-three derro that had been tied to the post and who had only recently
						had his hand sliced off by Seven-Stars. This accomplished Seven-Stars inisited on trying out the ritual on the cave bear that
						was spared when the group last past this way. After some inept animal handling the bear was positioned into the ritual center
						and after several hours and some psychic bullying by Zodius the bear'r mind was replaced with that of a resentful demon, "loyal"
						to Zodius. Just outside the exit of the tunnels Everin learned from <span class="npc">Pelek</span>, the deep-gnome ghost, that 
						the hand the group recovered is indeed his, but that to lay his ghost to rest the group will need to take all his remains to 
						<span class="location">Blingdenstone</span>, where his relatives will surely be thankful for his return. Everin grudgingly 
						agreed to possibly take the remains all the way, and collected them.

						The derro was hesitent to speak but Seven-Stars loosened his tongue by loosing his hand from his

						</span>As the party draws closer to <span class="location">Gracklstugh</span> two monstrous mermen rise out of the water
						and attack the boat, attempting to capsize it. The heroic efforts of <span class="pc">Francis</span> are able
						to stabilize the boat and <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> manages to leap onto one of the brutes and deal
						a killing blow, causing the other to flee. After this brief upset the group approaches one of the shabbier 
						docks of Gracklstugh.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first impressions of the city are unfavorable, though the sanctuary it offers from the desolate blackness of the
						surrounding Underdark lends it some charm. The city is a bleak expanse of monolithic stone buildings, most of which
						are dedicated to industry. The city is bustling, mostly with duergar, but many other Underdark races are present as 
						well mostly drow and orcs. There is also a large community of marginalized derro. Outsiders are restricted from 
						traveling beyond the gated <span class="location">Darklake District</span> of the city. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="npc">Hemeth</span> shows the party to the city's only inn that accepts outsiders as guests, <span class="location">
						The Gholbrorn's Lair</span>. The "Lair" is an complex of damp passages under the cities streets and apparently floods in 
						spring. Hemeth pays for the groups room and board for one week and offers to act as trader in the 
						the the citie's trading plaza, known as the <span class="location">Blade Bazaar</span>. After an unusual meal the group 
						retires to their rooms, some scrambling to obtain a private room for the night.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The following morning the group ventures out of their rooms and has another strange meal, they overhear some nearby
						patrons complaining about the increasingly dangerous trade routes and others complaining about the price of goods.
						Galifraen approaches one of the patrons and offers to sell the Kua-Toan boat the group stole but the trader baulks,
						citing the danger of sea trade. Shortly after Hemeth enters and the group leaves to trade.					
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The Blade Bazaar offers a complete catalog of mundane goods amongst the permanent stalls of it's many vendors. 
						While here the group manages to sell their boat for 700 gp, and uses the proceeds to outfit themselves more
						appropriately. Apart of arms and armor several memebers of the group opt for more opulent clothing, with 
						<span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> purchasing a fine cloak and brooch.
					</p>
					<p class="Core"></p>					
						Much of the day is spent trading, and while negotiating the purchase of a map of the Underdark, 
						a beserk, two-headed, grey-skinned giant crashes into the bazaar
						and begins attacking everything around it. Despite its size and strength the party is able to slay the mad giant,
						although <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span> suffers a haymaker to the face, knocking him unconcious. In the aftermath
						several duergar guards confer and another stone giant, named <span class="npc">Dorhun</span> arrives and is distraught 
						at his associates death. After a brief exchange with the party he takes offense at a remark of <span class="pc">Shithead</span>'s
						and leaves carrying the slain giant. The duergar guards converge on the group and escort them to a nearby official building
						for their statements. Seven-Stars also manages to find some prime fishguts and to dump them on Galifraen but is disappointed
						that this fails to turn Galifraen into cool Galifraen.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The building the group is taken to is an impressive stalagmite-bastion overlooking the Darklake. They are deposited into
						a spartan office before an official duergar named <span class="npc">Errde Blackskull</span> arrives and asks them about
						what happened. The group explains that the giant attacked unprovoked and slew a duergar right in front of them before they 
						engaged with it. Errde accepts this, then asks the characters to help her. She suspects a conspiracy among the leaders of the 
						derro, known as the "Council of Savants", that may involve some of the deurgar clan leaders (lairds) as well. A derro known as
						<span class="pc">Droki</span> is known to have illicit dealings with the savants but he has avoided capture or even pursuit 
						from her guards. She hopes that the adventures might have better luck as outsiders in tailing Droki. All she knows is that he lives
						in the <span class="location">West Cleft District</span> and frequents the Blade Bazaar. She believes that the conspiracy
						is somehow corrupting the minds of many of the duergar in the city and will reward evidence of corruption with gear from the
						duergar military's armory. She concludes by darkly mentioning that the adventurers should not attempt to leave the city without
						attending to Droki, implying that her "offer" is more of an ultimatum. Finally she gives each member of the party iron insignia
						bearing the mark of the Stone Gaurds (the military elite of Gracklstugh), which she says will grant them passage beyond the 
						Darklake District.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group decides to rest before heading to the West Cleft District and searching for Droki. During the evening several of them
						pass disguting black balls of tar-like flem and decide to purchase masks in the morning. While the rest of the group retires
						Shithead sets his heart on an orcish woman in the inn's common area but is attacked by a duergar slaver and decides to flee
						to the saftey of his room. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The following morning <span class="npc">Sareth</span> is too sick to leave bed, and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> demonstrates
						her deities favor by healing him of his coughing though the boils on his face continue to spread. The group travels to the 
						Blaze Bazaar and heads to area dominated by derro traders and buyers. Although coldy received the party asks about hiring 
						Droki through a contact named <span class="npc">Ylsa</span>, but when asked about Droki Ylsa claims ignorance, even when 
						presented with evidence that she does indeed know him. Disappointed in the lack of help, the group decides to head to 
						the West Cleft District and look for Droki there and as they leave a wretched derro begs Shithead for "summin ta' eat".
						It's request granted, the derro mutters that Droki wears a "floppy hat", before scurrying away into the bazaar.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Resuming their walk towards the West Cleft District, the group passes through one of the gates that border the Darklake District,
						and learn from the guards that Droki is a devious bastard. One of the guards also mentions abandoned guard towers that look into 
						the the West Cleft District and might provide a good vantage for watching the derro that come and go.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Beyond the gate of the Darklake the party find themselves in an even more bleak part of Gracklstugh, with even more forges and
						fumes than the Darklake District. They now make their way towards <span class="location">Laduguer's Furrow</span>, a great chasm
						in which many of the duergar live, the edges of which make up the east and west cleft districts.

					<h3>
						Session 9: Leemoogoogoon
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The frog-folk that approached last session indeed turn out to be friendly! They are lead by <span class="npc">Plooploopeen</span>,
						a frog-folk archpriest of a deity he refers to as "The Sea Mother". A slightly confused <span class="npc">Saren</span> 
						translates for group as Ploop explains to the group about his troubled village. Apparently his daughter has had
						visions which inspired her to oppose her father with the worship of a deity known as "The Deep Father". Ploop
						asked the group to accompany him back to the village as false prisoners, which he would offer to his daughter as
						sacrifices. Then he would attempt to kill her and her followers, with the help of the party. The group decided
						to accept in exchange for a guided passage across the <span class="location">Darklake</span> and towards 
						<span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>. 
					</p>	
					<p class="Core">
						Following the priest and his guards, the group is led into a vast cavern whose cheif feature is an
						immense lake. After trekking out onto an isthmus cutting across the lake and traveling for about an 
						hour the group finally arrives at the entrance to <span class="location">Sloobludop</span>. 
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> moves towards the lake's edge to fish but is dissuaded by the frog-folk
						who warn he may get pulled in.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The village is built across a portion of the isthmus and is protected by land with walls composed
						of tangled netting and hooks. Ploop escorts the party to his faction's area in the squalid village,
						with an unpleasant stature of a humanoid female carved of wood with a genuine crawfish head and
						claws strapped to it's figure with fishgut. Piled about its base are "offerings" mostly rotting 
						marine life. Inside his hut Ploop explains that he is going to parley with his daughter and offer
						you as sacrifices - he expects to return shortly. A heap of wealth temps <span class="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						to theivery but the rope leashing him to the rest of the party stays his paws. Ploop returns with the 
						good news - you are to be sacrified!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Ploop and the group are escorted under guard to the "Altar of the Deep Father" where the opposing 
						priest is preparing for the sacrifice. 
						<span class="figure">
							<img src="media/images/sloobludop/Altar.png" >
							Altar of the Deep Father
						</span>
						Three unconscious captives were  dragged in front of the altar and roused. A human, a duergar,
						and a halfing - or possibly goblin. Then the arhcpriestess orders her guards to prod the party towards
						these captives, she then utters a short prayer to the Deep Father.						
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Just before she signals for the sacrifice to begin, her father attacks her with his scepter - stunning her
						with the blow and signaling the party to strike! A few seconds of chaotic battle ensue before the priestess
						is slain with a blow to the head. Unfortunately the gore from her death christens the altar evoking an ominous
						roiling in the water of the lake. A terrible foe then bursts from the depths - a tentacle armed monstrosity with
						two <a href="importantnpcs.html#big_nasties">baboon</a> -like heads lumbers towards the village causing most of 
						the surviving frog-folk to panic, pray, or flee.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Witnessing such a horror manifested overcomes some of the adventures. Seven-Stars begins miming as though he were
						eating food. Shithead falls unconcious <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> takes the chance splattering of fishgut across his eyes as an
						act of providence, becoming much endeared to said fishguts. Feeling confident Galifraen aims a shot at the 
						massive creature hulking toward the village but somehow misses. This decides most of the party is a clear indication
						that it is time to flee. The frog-folk are too scattered and panicked to offer any resistance to the group stealing
						a large Kuo-Toan keelboat. The three captives who were to be sacrificed also manage to join the group although 
						Seven-Stars is nearly left behind to perish. As the group rows the alien craft away from the carnage a inadvertant
						tentacle lash from Leemoogoogoon knocks <span class="npc">Stool</span> overboard - but it is promptly rescued.
						Tragically the group realizes too that the <span class="pc">Moa</span> vanished during the conflict, and likely died
						in the frog-folk village.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Shortly after their escape the party gets aquainted with their new companions. <span class="pc">Francis</span> is
						a young adult human male with a warriors background - though he says little about himself, <span class="pc">Shithead</span>
						is an ugly halfing, or plain-looking goblin, and <span class="npc">Helmeth</span> is a severe duergar with shifty
						eyes. After a brief discussion the group decides to travel to Gracklstugh, where they hope to finally aquire some 
						equipment worth of their talents.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Crossing the Darklake
					</h4>
					<p class="Core">
						With Gracklstugh as a destination the group starts rowing with gusto, breaking themselves into three 
						shifts of 2 rowers + a navigator. This means the oars are operated continously and cuts the journey
						of 10 days down to just 3! The group soon learns that the less time spent on the water, the better...
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Only a few hours into the first day a levitating 70 lb brain featuring a beak the size of an arm
						and stinging tenctacles decends silently down onto the boat and attempts to make a meal of Galifraen. 
						Failing in this the brain goes for Zodius and pulls him up and into the darkness above the sailing
						craft. Galifraen harpoons the beast with a rope-tethered crossbow bolt while most of the party 
						is forced to watch - having no way to attack a creature so far away. Zodius teleports away
						and Galifraen sends another bolt into the creature - killing it. Francis steers the vessel
						under the gently falling corpse and a bounty of meat is secured. <span class="pc">Onnie</span>
						assures everyone that she can purify fouled food and drink and so the group has enough to 
						sustain them for the journey!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next two days are fraught with danger, with the first shift of rowers suffering the most. Several
						sentient manta ray attack the hull of the boat but give up a short time later. A voice calls out 
						for help while some of the taller members of the party knock their heads against a low overhang - Helmeth
						believes the voice to be that of one of the hags local to the Darklake area. A swarm of leathery mosquito
						like monsters buzz angrily about the parties heads during a rockfall - but soon pass on to a new home. 
						Perhaps most notably, four frog-folk happen within sight of the party and are pursued and subjected to 
						a cruel confiscation of most of their meagre equipment. Galifraen is noted for leaping onto the frog-folk's
						ship despite a spear hitting him mid-leap! Also notably is Shithead's conduct during the raid during which
						she recovered a muscle shell from among the bowels of one of the Kua-Toa - all of whom she "searched". Finally,
						the party wrestled with a gangly aquatic giant intent on draggin the boat into a whirlpool. When this failed 
						the giant attempted to board the boat by climbing up one side. Zodius was quite vocal about his plans to
						catapult the giant 50 feet into the air by leaping to one side of the boat but failed to convince his
						fellow adventurers. but was flung off by a powerful feat of strength by Francis. The effects of eating 
						nothing but brains for the last two days appear to have begun taking a toll on the groups mental state
						about this time as well as most of the party seemed more confused and boisterous than typical.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Shorly after the ordeal with the troll the party enters another of the great chambers of the Darklake area,
						and can dimly make out an orange smoldering light in the distance. Gracklstugh is within sight! Only an hour
						or so remains before they reach the city of the duergar! During this last stretch of rowing Galifraen
						has an abrupt change of heart regarding the fishguts, finding them suddenly abhorrent. He casts them into the water
						before washing his face, then seeks solitude in the hold of the boat. Jeering from Shithead makes this impossible
						and Galifraen decides instead to sulk at the edge of the boat, overcast by the twinkling smokey light of your next
						destination... Gracklstugh.

						triumphant, felling 3 of their 4 pursuers. <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> even manages to collect 
						a scalp during the chase. Unfortunately the battle turns when the last surviving drow regroups with
						your former warden<a href="importantnpcs.html#jailers"> <span class="npc">Ilvara</span></a>!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Ilvara's ire is manifested in a swarm of infuriated maggot-wasps which mercilessly sting several of the 
						heroes, some to the point of unconciousness. <span class="pc">Moa</span> addresses the swarm with
						a lesson on good, evil, and agency - speculating that, as maggots, they posses bodies symbolic
						of metamorphosis, and that their actions now will doubtless determine the shape of their mature form. 
						This slightly calms the swarm so that they do not attack Moa, and do not impede movement. Moa uses
						this opportunity to drag the unconcious Galifraen out of the swarm. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="pc">Zodius</span> ensures Galifraen's immediate recovery with a portentious certainty
						that Galifraen will 'roll a 20 on his next death saving throw'. <span class="pc">Onnie</span>	moves
						to attack Ilvara but, hearing god suggest she flee, decides to run instead. The rest of the group 
						decide to flee as well and a long chase through the underdark ensues.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						For 4 minutes the party runs like mad. Jagged stones, exploding mushrooms, steep ascents, giant flea migrations, 
						wasp-maggots bites, poisonous spores and a slippery streambed confound a clean escape. During the 5th minute
						several members of the group must pause for breath, and are relieved to find they have escaped their pursuers.
						Taking stock they learn that <span class="npc">Prince Derendil</span> and <span class="npc">Eldeth</span> 
						were lost during the flight. <span class="npc">Jorlan</span>, the drow guard who helped you escape, was among
						your pursuers, and cut Eldeth down.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a brief march to a safer locale, the party rests, and afterward decides to head to continue on to the 
						Kua-Toan village of <span class="location">Sloobludop</span>. The group plans to enter the village with 
						<span class="npc">Sareth</span> as a drow seeking passage, accompanied by Moa in the form of some undeground
						animal. However the group must still travel 2 days to reach the village and so they set out once more.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Their journey is impeded by a maze of webs, and also by a pair of Gricks which ambush the party. The gricks are 
						easily dispatched, though the moral justification for slaying them remains controvesal. Zodius firebolts a path
						through the webs and the group camps once more before making the final trek into Sloobludop.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group revises their plan, and decides to use the glowing stones they found, as well as some spore-caviar
						as offerings to the Kuo-Toans, in exchange for a guided passage accross the darklakes. An hour outside of town
						the group is threatened by several frog-folk who wish to sacrifice the adventurers to their 'Deep Father' deity.
						Onnie attempts to awe the leader of the frogs with some magic and cool eyes but the effect is diminished by her 
						struggle with some netting over her head. The frog men attack, their leader felling Onnie, and later <span class="pc">Everin</span>
						until Onnie is healed at which point she rises up and smites the leader with an awesome blow which sends the whole
						group of frogs hopping into the darkness. Just as the party regroups and plans to rest another knot of Kua-Toa 
						approach, this time peacably and eager confer. What will come of this meeting of amphibian and adventurer?

					<h3>
						Session 7: Gracious Grazzilax
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						After fleeing into the labryrinthine tunnels south of their former prison,<span class="location">Velkynevelve</span>,
						the group takes a moment to decide on a course of travel. A brief discussion determines that the drow <span class="npc">
						Sareth</span> is the only being with sufficient knowledge of the underdark to navigate without a map. The closest
						areas know to the drow are described:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Darklakes (7 days) - A large region of the underdark characterized by numerous underground lakes linked by 
							submerged tunnels and waterways. Traveling here is faster than on foot, but requires a boat.</li>
						<li>Menzoberranzan (26 days) - Most powerful of the drow cities, going here would certainly result in recapture</li>
						<li>Gracklstugh (20 days) - Stronghold of duergar and derro, a dangerous place but secure from drow attack, shortest route
							lies across the darklakes </li>
						<li>Neverlight Grove (24 days) - Home of Stool, a cavern of friendly sentient fungi</li>
						<li>Sloobludop (8 days) - Village of frog-men, attitude toward outsiders varies</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Core">
						It is decided that the immediate destination be <span class="location">Sloobludop</span> as the drow and the frog-men
						are not generally on good terms and a ship for crossing the darklakes should be accessible. Sareth warns the group that
						the frog-men (or Kuo-Toa in their own tongue) are as likely to be friendly as they are to be hostile, depending on the 
						mood of the prevailing high preist. The group also learns that the village is comprised of about 500 Kuo-Toans and that
						<span class="npc">Shushaar</span>, one of the the unfortunate prisoners who did not escape with you, mentioned that 
						the priesthood in the village was divided. After aquiring a boat the group plans to cross a portion of the darklakes
						aiming for <span class="location">Neverlight Grove</span>
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						With a clear destination the group resumes their journey, having left their prison without provisions the group must
						forage for food and water, which proves challenging in the alien undeground world. Without the familiar cycles of 
						night and day it is challenging to track time, and for now it is marked by the frequency of the group's need to rest.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first "day" of travel proves very unpleasant for <span class="npc">Sareth</span>,<span class="npc">Eldeth</span>, <span class="pc">Galifraen</span>, and 
						<span class="pc">Everin</span>. Maddening voices subvert and malign the traveler's psyche during this day and the aforementioned
						adventurures succumb to the lunatic whispers of the tunnel. Eldeth fled in a panic while Sareth crumpled into a histeric ball 
						on the stone floor. Galifraen stared into the space in front of his eye and Everin begin attacking everyone around him.
						Fortunately <span class="pc">Moa</span> determined that these afflictions would only persist for minutes, and those who had danced with madness
						soon recovered their wits. When asked if such unpleasantness was common in the underdark Sareth responded in the negative.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After an unpleasant rest in a damp chamber the group traveled another day, and found water and food for all.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next day is equally bleak with the added unpleasantness of an inadequate supply of food and water. While encamped the
						group encountered a pair of Kuo-Toan traders who offered an assortment of trinkets but were ultimately left without exchanging goods.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The fourth period of travel is uneventful, but hunger and thirst threaten to overwhelm the travelers. Several are quite exhausted 
						and are having trouble keeping pace. Near their campsite Everin and <span class="pc">Onnie</span> spot a sinister fungi protruding 
						from the ceiling.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The fifth period of travel is dreadful at first, but late in the march a chamber spotted with growths of luminous 
						quartz is discovered, and in it a generous squid-headed creature. The creatue calls itself <span class="npc">Grazzilax</span>
						and offers the party aid in exchange for some "new data". Galifraen satifies the creature with a lecture on the sublties of 
						high elf blood relations. Grazzilax vanishes into the air, then reappears with water and food aplenty. He warns the group that
						the crystals in the chamber are explosive, a solid blow being sufficient to shatter them and release a flash of bright light.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Their growing thirst and hunger satisfied, and Sloobludop only 3 rest-cycles away, the groups fortunes seems brighter, especially
						under the warm glow of the quartz... 
					</p>

				<section id="session6">
					<h3>
						Session 6: Prisonbreak!
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						You awaken in a daze on cold stone floor of a slave pen deep underground. All of the
						group is present, as well as 10 other captives. All your possessions, except your
						clothes, have been taken. <span class="pc">Everin</span> speaks  undercommon and enables
						the rest of the group to converse with <a href="importantnpcs.html#session1Prisoners">the other prisoners</a> ,
						the most talkataive of which is <span class="npc">Jimjar</span>. The group learns that the wardens are drow who
						come three times every 24 hours (or every 48 pulses of one of the more prominent patches
						of flourescent fungi).They also tell the group that they arrived in a stupor and fell unconcious
						onto the floor for several hours before waking now.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Soon several drow arrive and take 2 of the group, along with 4 other prisoners out for hard labor.
						This happens 3 times before the adventurers are able to rest, with duties including shit-squeegeeing,
						rock breaking, rope coiling, rock piling, and bucket-lift operating. The upshot of this being that
						by the end of the third shift your group has a fair idea of the extents of the prison and its grounds.
						Most of the labor is uneventful, although <span class="pc">Galifraen</span> gets into trouble not lifting
						rocks with enough gusto and is clocked by a nearby Quaggoth. Galifraen feigns unconciousness in order to avoid
						further degrading himslef with rock piling.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A period of inactiivty follows the third shift of hard labor and gruel is brought to the cell. The party 
						considered their predicament and ask for a show of hands of those who would like to escape, all of the prisoners
						except the Dark Elf, <span class="npc">Sareth</span> indicate they wish to escape. Zodius and a egg-shaped sentient
						fungus become friends, and Stool creates a telepathic link between all of the prisoners. The Kuo-Toa yogi, <span class="npc">
						Shushaar</span>, breaks his silence and shares some gossip on one of the more important drow in the prison. According
						to Shushaar, a drow name <span class="npc">Jorlan</span> was recently disfigured in combat and has lost the favor of his
						lover, the commander of the prison, <span class="npc">Ilvara</span>, a drow high priestess. To make matters worse
						Ilvara has taken a new lover from among the drow at the prison further embittering Jorlan. Armed with this intel the 
						party plots to exploit Jorlans pain for their own benefit.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						During the next days hard labor <span class="pc">Moa</span> speaks with Jorlan, but is met with cold disinterest
						when she offers him the aid of the prisoners. Later Galifraen gets into trouble again, this by
						making indecent remarks concerning a neaby drow priestess to the guards. The guards decide to feed
						him to the giant spiders living in the webs below the prison but decide 4 bolts to the torso adequate punishment
						instead. Jorlan comes to the gate of the cell later and without prompting offers to leave the gate open
						for the party on the following day. The party agrees and eagerly await their escape.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a third day of menial labor Jorlan returns, and discreetly unlocks the gate while collecting the gruel
						bowls. He then leaves and Galifraen's keen eyes notice him leading away two of the guards in the chamber beyond 
						the slave pen. Everin and Seven-Stars sneak out and across the bridge, and botch an attempt to garrote the lone
						remaining guard. The rest of the group hustles across the narrow bridge and into the guardroom and quickly dispatch 
						him silently. In hurried movements the group arm themselves with crossbows and swords, some choosing armor 
						as well. Ront cleaves the silk bridge that connects the slave pen and guard house which alerts the guards and
						a battle ensues!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Galifraen is the first to leap into the spiderwebs below, with Zodius hanging onto his tunic. The land and
						are stuck, with 4 giant spiders approaching and drow shooting down at them with crossbows. The ensuing seconds 
						are a chaos of fighting and desparate wriggling in the webs. Shuushar is dragged away by spiders and Ront is 
						felled by arrows. Quaggoths demonstate their ability to climb cliff faces and close in. Zodius, Onnie, Everin and 
						Moa escape the webs and leap into the water below. Stool, Eldeth, Sareth and Derendil also escape. Those remaining
						find themselves pressed by the quaggoth, drow and spiders. Galifraen narrowly avoids recapture in the webs and 
						leaps into the pool as well.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Below on the cavern floor, pursued by quaggoth, the party escape through a passage into a maze of tunnels. For now 
						they have escaped the drow, but they will need food and water soon... hunger may yet prove a crueler master than 
						any drow.

						Session 5: The Wyvern's Tale
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						A new day dawns in <span class="location">Ashabenford</span> and two
						new adventurers enter town with the dawn. <span class="pc">Lilly-Warrior</span>
						awakens in an alley recovering from a concussion suffered in
						an unremembered past. She overhears Galifraen, Everin, and Onnie
						discussing matters outside <span class="location">The White Hart Inn</span>
						before going inside. Down the lane, another newcomer, <span id="pc">Seven-Stars</span>
						also hears the conversations and is drawn to to signet rings the two
						speakers are wearing.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Everin and Onnie play at dice and drink inside the Inn while 
						Galifraen broods. Seven-Stars enters the inn and while the 
						stable boy/barkeep <span class="npc">Barnaby</span> leaves
						SS borrows a fancy mug from behind the bar and pours himself
						a drink, then sits down next to Galifraen, disturbing the high-elf.
						Onnie helps Lilly-Warrior with her head injury before the innkeep 
						returns and, perceiving SS's ruse about Galifraen drinking from 
						the mug, kick SS out of the bar. The innkeep then describes
						a ranger, known as <span class="npc">Zoloft</span> who may
						be able to help the group find drow and wyverns in the forest.
						Zoloft conveniently appears and offers his services in aquiring
						wyvern stingers, explaining that the mage <span class="npc">Noristuor</span>
						has hired him to help. The group enlists the aid of SS and Lilly-Warrior
						before leaving town with in their Wagon, with Moa in horse form pulling.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The first day's travel takes you out of town north along the 
						road called the 'Moonsea Ride'. You pass through many farms
						and fields. It being late autumn there are numerous squash and
						grains growing in the fields. By nightfall you have left the main
						road and traveled to the edge of the forest which Zoloft calls 
						'The Rimwood'. Before bedding down for the night you are attacked
						by two owl-bears which you quickly dispatch. Lilly-Warrior, who
						was concerned about not having enough to eat makes use of the bear
						meat.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The next day takes you through the Rimwood, which is sparesly
						populated with pines and low shrubs. Insects and numerous 
						and by nightfall Zoloft admits he is lost but assures you tomorrow
						will find you a wyvern. Before bedding down Moa holds an audience
						with the local ants and drives them off with bad-vibes, in exchange
						for a wasp sting.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The third day brings you into the 'Midwood', which is cooler, more
						humid, and more crowded with trees. Oak and maple are common and small
						mammals are common. By evening Zoloft has found a wyvern lair by a creek
						and he explains that you are in a area of the forest where animal diets
						are inverted - so the wyvern should be herbiverous and therfore less
						challenging to slay. You prepare a snare trap and await the beast, rubbing
						yourselves in red maple to mask your scent from it.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The wyvern arrives and is fooled by a spread of fruit illusioned by 
						Zodius. The trap works as well and your group lays into the beast, 
						slaying it without too much trouble. Unfortunately strange magic
						and a drow ambush immediately follow your victory and in less than
						a minute your entire group, except possibly Zoloft, have succumbed
						to the ambush.

					<p class="Core">
						You traveled back to Ashabenford, collecting Torgo, the awkward

					<h3>
						Session 4
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						You and your fellows dosed on the purple powder and entered
						a dream realm much like the mansion. A satyr-like man attacked
						and you managed to slay him, though some of you suffered very
						bad dreams following the encounter. With his defeat you went
						outside and collected the last of the 4 shards which you then
						took into the cellar.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The demon Donamoth appeared in the fog surrounding his lair
						and boasted before vanishing. After some attempts at entering
						the fog while holding the shards one slipped out of hand and
						into the barrier, seemingly weakening it. You let go the remaining
						shards and the barrier fell, revealing a circular chamber covered
						over with diabolic runes where Donamoth waited.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After a brief dialog your group attacked the demon and managed
						to dispatch the brute without much trouble. Though he left behind
						nothing Galifraen examined a sarcophagus in the chamber and learned
						it contained the remains of a ward who died, along with six others,
						to bind some great evil. You went outside and found that the 
						mansion was no longer trapped within the impenetrable fog... you
						were free! Before leaving you investigated the chest upstairs and
						found a dandy, calling himself
						<span class="npcName">
							Dbard
						</span>
						inside. He promised to write of your exploits and pay you half his 
						earnings for one nights performance if you spared  him.

					<h3>
						Session 3
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						Before settling into a short rest your previously vanquished
						foe rose up from the floor and landed one last blow before
						expiring. Your rest completed, you continued to explore the
						second floor of the mansion and encountered the demonic face
						of your host who took control of a stuffed wolf-man and
						attacked you! Then you smashed the jade figurine you obtained
						earlier to see what was inside, you found jade dust. Shortly
						after a toy room with a malicious leprechaun doll also attacked
						you. You managed to destroy both but were in need of rest so
						returned downstairs and barricaded yourselves with REW RA in
						the dining room. Your rest was interrupted by two unfortunate
						Red Listens who you quickly slew before completing your 
						long naps.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Refreshed you continue to explore and in the cellar and found
						an ancient sword in a passage behind some wine casks. You also
						had a brief interview with the host who appeared on the surface
						of a seemingly impenetrable barrier of fog. The head made clear
						it wants you dead... but you already knew that. Traveling back
						outside you found that the 4 statues in the garden had transformed
						and that each appear to represent a powerful servant of Donamoth, 
						two of the statues had crumbled revealing a purple fist-sized shard
						within which you took. You then found Torgo in some bushes and 
						learned that one of the powerful being represented by the statues,
						"Kruugar the dream sage", was only to be found within
						your heads - and that he came only while you slept. You decided
						to go to the greenhouse first and there slew a plant-elf horror
						without much trouble.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Returning to the house you investigated what you believe to 
						be the only remaining rooms downstairs and slew several more
						Red Listen cultists who had barricaded themselves in an attempt 
						to escape your wrath. While completing your sweep of the downstairs
						you passed through a library where a decapitated cultist lay. You
						took the book he was reading and two other books bound similarly
						as well as a text on alchemical reagents. With the mansion
						apparently cleared of foes (except for the host trapped in the 
						cellar) you gathered in the parlor and discussed attempting to
						sleep as a means of encountering Kruugar.

						Session 2
					</h3>
					<p class="Core">
						The host arrived and asked you all to play a guessing game. He was a middle-aged human with a large mustache and a red face and his likeness appeared on the staues in the courtyard, leading you to believe he was Quincy. However he appears to be some kind of monster who inhabited Quincy's body! You learned all this when he ambushed your group with animated chairs and murdered Brunor. After you smashed the chairs and slew the insane serving maid the head of a demon appeared in the fireplace and "ate" Brunor's soul. It then swore to eat your souls as well before vanishing in the flames.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Your group left the dining area
						and began to to explore the mansion, except for REW RA who slept
						soundly on the dining table. Soon you ran into Torgo again, who was
						being bullied by a scrawny youth with a pimply face in a large
						red-cowled robe. You slew the youth with a single arrow as he
						turned to attack you and asked Torgo about what was going on. Torgo
						took a long time to explain but the gist was that:
					</p>
					<ul class="Chapter_CORE-BULLETED">
						<li>
							A group calling itself the "Red Listens", wearing red robes believe that an army of extra-planar creatures will dominate this world soon.
						</li>
						<li>
							10 days ago the leaders of the group were instructed to come to the mansion to free one said extra-planar creatures
						</li>
						<li>
							The cultists came and slew everyone in the mansion
						</li>
						<li>
							In the cellar a coffin was opened by the group and the entity within in possessed the body of the manison's owner.
						</li>
						<li>
							This owner, who Torgo called "The Master", then altered the 4 chief members of the Red Listens in some way to make them more powerful.
						</li>
						<li>
							One was made strong (Torgo's Uncle), another was made small, the third vanished when he slept and now walks in dreams, and the fourth died during the process.
						</li>
						<li>
							When the third died one of the guests at the mansions before the attack was found hiding in the green house and was changed "into a bush er--- planted".
						</li>
						<li>
							Some "ancient things" (valuables) are upstairs
						</li>
						<li>
							Torgo wants to leave and is hiding outside among the hedges in the courtyard for now.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="Core">
						After Galifraen aquired some archaic but functional chainmail you traveled upstairs in search of valuables. Passing by an enchanted suit of armor that strikes out with it's halbered at anyone who gets close, you slew 2 sleeping cultists and tricked a third, and rather vain cultist who you then killed. On him you found some strange purple powder which induces a deep sleep on anyone who comes into contact with it. Later you found a shit-covered lavatory, and looked out over a large balcony to discover that the world outside was somehow cut-off by a great amber-red cloud of fog. Attempting to pass through the fog with Horace the owl proved unfruitful - some kind of spacial distortion prevent travel much beyond 80' of the mansion roof, and probably halts travel beyond or to the gate. You also found a trunk in a room which held some frightened creature but you decided not to attempt to open the chest by force and instead locked it.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back inside you found two more cultists looking for a hand like object in a room of curios, along with a brute of a man who stood by silently. One of you passes himself off as a cultist again and stabbed the large man, but was brutally repaid with a blow which knocked him unconcious. A unpleasant fight ensued but your group emerged victorious, though wounded.

						I, Jerfort Qunicy Wutherton III, cordially invite you to attend supper at my country home in Mistledale. You may have heard of me from my exploits abroad.
								I am enclosing 10 sovereigns in the hope that you will find them sufficient cause to attend the meeting I have planned.
								Arrangments have been made at the White Hart Inn in Ashabenford for your reception should you arrive early.

						Please do come, I am not a spiritual man but have had strange dreams of late, and believe our fates are somehow intertwined.
								I feel I somehow owe you a debt, and hope meeting with you personally will jog my memory... The innkeep at the White Stag 
								will have instructions for you once you arrive.
						<br>
						Your friend,
						<br>
						Quincy

						You decided to head to The White Stag, and met several other adventurers who had received similiar letters, save for Ottie, who had seen all of the letter-holders in a dream.
						After some discussion you decided to travel with these adventurers
						to the Manor and asked around the tavern for information on Quincy. You learned that he was well respected as an explorer and collector of exotic relics. A while later rustic 
						coach arrived (more of a straw wagon) and took you out of town on a 2-hour journey along the forest's edge. At some point on the ride a wolf print was found, as well as some
						light shining from among the trees in the distance. Your driver was friendly, though he knew little of Quincy.

					<p class="Core">
						Arriving at the gates of the mansion you observed a roughly 200-year-old building, fit for a noble. You proceeded into the courtyard and noted several statues
						with plaques depicting Quincy in various heroic poses in exotic lands. Knocking at the front door you met Torgo, the awkward butler of the estate. Torgo led you
						into the dining room where you met another guest who called himself "Brunor". Torgo poured drinks while Brunor asked you about yourselves, and you learned that Brunor
						had received a letter similiar to yours and that he is a grain merchant. Rew ate some of the bread and fell into a deep sleep while the rest of you spoke with each other
						and waited for the host to arrive.
