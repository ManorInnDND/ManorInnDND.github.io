				Investigate the Cult of The Red Listen (?)
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				The Red Listen was the name of the cult that set you up in the

			<p class="Chapter_SECTION-HEADER-2">
				Deport Donamoth (?)
			</p>
			<p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY">
				Donamoth, the demon who claimed vengeance against you for actions
				you supposedly took in a past life was defeated in his cave below
				the spoooky mansion. However his defeat seemed impernanent as
				he merely dissolved into black smoke. A sarcophagus in the cave
				contained the remains of a "Abn Bard Furgo", who sacrified himself
				along with six others to imprison some "great evil", presumably
				Donamoth. If Donamoth is not dead he may attempt to take vengeance
				on you again, though possibly not during this lifetime.
