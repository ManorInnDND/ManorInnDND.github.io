        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">Before settling into a short rest your previously vanquished foe rose up from the floor and landed one last blow before expiring. Your rest completed, you continued to explore the second floor of the mansion and encountered the demonic face of your host who took control of a stuffed wolf-man and attacked you! Then you smashed the jade figurine you obtained earlier to see what was inside, you found jade dust. Shortly after a toy room with a malicious leprechaun doll also attacked you. You managed to destroy both but were in need of rest so returned downstairs and barricaded yourselves with REW RA in the dining room. Your rest was interrupted by two unfortunate Red Listens who you quickly slew before completing your long naps. </p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">Refreshed you continue to explore and in the cellar found a and found an ancient sword in a passage behind some wine casks. You also had a brief interview with the host who appeared on the surface of a seemingly impenetrable barrier of fog. The head made clear it wants you dead... but you already knew that. Traveling back outside you found that the 4 statues in the garden had transformed and that each appear to represent a powerful servant of Donamoth, two of the statues had crumbled revealing a purple fist-sized shard within which you took. You then found Torgo in some bushes and learned that one of the powerful being represented by the statues, &quot;Kruugar the dream sage&quot;, was only to be found within your heads - and that he came only while you slept. You decided to go to the greenhouse first and there slew a plant-elf horror without much trouble.</p>
        <p class="Chapter_CORE-BODY-INDENT">	Returning to the house you investigated what you believe to be the only remaining rooms downstairs and slew several more Red Listen cultists who had barricaded themselves in an attempt to escape your wrath. While completing your sweep of the downstairs you passed through a library where a decapitated cultist lay. You took the book he was reading and two other books bound similarly as well as a text on alchemical reagents. With the mansion apparently cleared of foes (except for the host trapped in the cellar) you gathered in the parlor and discussed attempting to sleep as a means of encountering Kruugar.</p>
